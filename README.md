# It works!

# Alison built a Magic Instagram Bot 


## Intro  

I found that the newly released independently published books, zines, and artists' books arenâ€™t really compiled anywhere. You can maybe hear about the more popular ones through big art book fairs or by following a few wellknown indie bookstores like Printed Matter, and looking at their curated lists. But I think we could all benefit from a little Instagram bot that automatically posts about niche new books.

Written in a storybook style, this tutorial documents my process in creating this workflow.
1. Scraped book listings from Shopify-based and static HTML indie bookstore sites  
2. Built an Instagram bot using the official Instagram Graph API to post the cover, title, and description of new books from stores like Center for Book Arts, and Bungee Space  
3. Set up a workflow to keep the list of books updated
