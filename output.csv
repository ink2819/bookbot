One part is an interactive Prompt Book designed to explore, thoroughly experience, and actively engage with physical environments. The other part is a collection of images created by using the Prompt Book, accompanied by texts that critically examine topics such as walking, navigation, perception, and media. With its interwoven content,Moving Through Imagesaddresses questions such as: What are the relationships between what we see and perceive in our physical surroundings and how they are depicted? Is a place perceived differently in its physical form compared to its visual reproductions or simulations?Browsing through a book’s pages is analogous to moving through the streets of a city. One always has only a section of a larger entity in front of one’s eyes—the street through which one is currently moving, a sentence, a paragraph, or a page that one is reading. The often seemingly random connections and correlations between individual fragments and situations must always be discovered first.Concept, design, editor: David GalloAuthors: Jean Baudrillard, Raphael Besenbäck, Jorge Luis Borges, Guy Debord, David Gallo, Carmen Lael Hines, Nadine Monemartedition ·VerlagBibliothek der ProvinzISBN: 978-3-99126-340-1Main volume (20×10 cm, 320 pages, numerous illustrations, softcover in a thread-bound binding with an open book edge) & Prompt Book (20×10 cm, 168 pages, folded, laceable with elastic band and cord)Text in English"

Evolving from research conducted for a video work, this book unfolds as a sensory archive and speculative inquiry into female Taoist communities, displaced sanctity, marginalized mythologies, and the missing body. Guided by spiritual figures such as Mazu, Guanyin, and the Seven Fairies, Perry weaves together field research, fictional fragments, poetic reflection, and visual stills into a rich, multi-layered constellation.The book interlaces temple visits, interpretations of ritual and myth, oral history interviews, encounters with local women practitioners, and atmospheric documentation of sacred sites. This practice extends beyond conventional research, posing a sustained question: How can missing be recorded without the desire to restore or retrieve?Instead of offering resolution, „Missing“ invites readers into the emotional topography of being lost. It is not a search for someone, but a journey undertaken without knowing what has gone missing. In this sense, “disappearance” becomes a generative state from which futurity might emerge.WritersMooni PerryShih-yu HsuN̂g Bo̍k-siôngScriptYan LinMooni PerryIntervieweeLee Fong-maoTranslator (Korean to English)Chaeyoung KimLocal Storytellers in TaiwanN̂g Bo̍k-siôngFiber Chang Hsin TingAtalanta ChangTarot Cards WriterHyejeong YunTarot Cards IllustratorSaitemissLithographyJan SchefflerAmong many, special thanks toPeng Chi-yuanKristina ScepanskiMazu (媽祖) and Tshit-niû-má (七娘媽)Editor: You FengDesign: Sam KimSize: 120 x 170 mmColorPage: 280Including a folded paper house poster and 10 tarot cardsPublished by– Common Imprint, Berlin– Mediabus, Seoul– Westfälischer Kunstverein, MünsterPublished in April 2025Language: English"

A distant storm, out of sight, is often the cause of a ground-sea.”InGround Sea, Peng re-orchestrates photographs spanning over a decade and multiple projects into a new diptych-structured work. The first part,Sunset Watchers, unfolds through black-and-white portraits of three women reenacting a phantom folktale following the 1896 tsunami in Japan—images that also allude to the anxious premonition of those living with depression. Interspersed colored photographs recall Peng’s bodily memory of being bedridden due to illness. The second part,Kuāfù Chases The Sun, carries stills from two video works about Peng’s father, who retired from the People’s Liberation Army ten years after his daughter left home. In these images, his body is constantly propelled forward by the cogs of a system, breaking the stagnation of the first part, only to fall into nothingness ultimately.Peng likens the depressed body to a receptor and amplifier of signals from the future, much like the camera she holds in her hands. In the tension between stillness and motion, waiting and chasing, the book poses a question: Are those paralyzed by the impending catastrophe in need of treatment, or is it the society—numbed by its relentless pursuit of progress—that requires awakening?First published in 202520.3 × 27 cmChinese, EnglishOffset printing, exposed bindingPhotography and Concept: Kanthy PengPoet: Geng YaoDesigner: Muxi Gao, Company Per Form阚辛的首部艺术家书《地浪》以73张照片编织了一场关于抑郁、记忆与失落的视觉叙事。书名“地浪”源于古代西印度群岛人使用的词汇。人类学家、女性主义者Emily Martin在观摩情感性疾患的临床会诊教学时，用“地浪”来形容她的所见所感，“……指的是在晴朗的天气里，毫无任何明显原因之下，海洋突然隆起，以沉重咆哮的巨浪之势扑上岸边。造成地浪的原因，通常是一场发生在肉眼所及之外的遥远风暴。”在《地浪》中，跨越十年、散落于多个项目的照片被阚辛重新构建为一部双曲结构的新作。第一部分《等日落的人》由三名女性的黑白肖像串联，她们重演了日本1896年海啸后的幽灵传说，画面同时也指涉了抑郁症者对未来的焦灼预感；彩色摄影则回溯了艺术家因疾病长期卧床不起的身体记忆。第二部分《夸父逐日》由两部关于父亲的影像作品的截帧构成，阚辛的父亲在女儿离乡十年后从解放军退休，画面中他的身体被不断运转的齿轮裹挟前进，打破了前半部分的 “停滞”状态，却最终陷入虚无。在《地浪》中，阚辛将抑郁的身体比作接收和放大未来信号的装置，就如她手中的相机一样。在静止与动态、等待与追逐的博弈中，这本书质问：究竟是因将至的灾难而深陷抑郁的个体更需要被治疗，还是在盲目进步中逐渐麻木不仁的社会更需要被唤醒？2025第一次印刷20.3 x 27厘米中英双语胶版印刷，裸脊装订摄影及概念：阚辛诗歌：更杳书籍设计：高沐曦, Company Per Form"

From the manifesto, Oakley states:What do we mean when we say “profit” (in the not-for-profit to for-profit spectrum)? As a person trying to live off the “profit” they generate from their work, profit is essential to my livelihood and my ability to continue producing work I am passionate about. So, to say that I am a for-profit does not yet speak to the complexities of a minor, non-capitalist publishing project. The word “profit” without any other context is a simplification; it can’t speak to the complexities of what making a profit means for my life, work, and future. GenderFail is not not-for-profit but profit-for-survival, or profit-to-continue-our-work-without-other-means-of-capital -- and most importantly, to make money for the people I publish, to create profit-for-labor. Defining the means of non-exploitative-profit by describing how our work is created, who is being paid, and the ethics behind its creation is essential when determining the terms of any engagement with “profit.”5th Edition of 15020 pagesRisograph (Black, Red, and Medium Blue)"

Its unique shape drew my attention: “What is this tree doing here?” It was standing straight up, growing higher over the fences, and the sun was passing through the buildings and penetrating the leaves. The green and yellow color of the leaves looked inexplicably energetic in the shimmering light. Suddenly I noticed that there are a lot of papaya trees near my neighbors, most of them grow alone in the middle of buildings or by the roadsides.They don’t have much agricultural value, but they appear in all corners of cities as a very natural, normal existence.I started to look for the traces of these papaya trees and their history by researching historical archives, taking photos, sketching and drawing, I started to realize the papaya trees had it’s own stories, deeply rooted in the colonized past. Looking at these papaya trees being a nomad in the city, I feel somehow accompanied when I get lost in identity questions. This book represents my perception of the place I call home.This book is divided into three chapters:The first chapter, ""The Long-Living Ancient Papaya,"" showcases images and records I discovered while researching the history of papaya trees in Taiwan.The second chapter, ""Nomad Papaya’s Journey"" features papaya trees I photographed in various regions of Taiwan, coexisting with architecture and concrete structures.The third chapter, ""Nomad Papaya’s Streaming Movement and Self-Portrait with Blue and White Canvas Block ,"" includes a series of illustrations of a somewhat “chaotic” feeling.The blue and white canvas is a common industrial material in Taiwan, resistant to rain and wind, often used to cover building materials in the construction site. This section resembles a floating state as I shuttle between memories, images, and daily life.這本書始於2018年左右，一次散步偶然在路上發現一顆木瓜樹。可能因為造型特別，我內心第一個os：「它在這幹嘛？」，它直挺挺的越過了圍牆，太陽經過大樓的縫隙穿越葉子，綠黃相間的顏色在晃動中看起來莫名有元氣。突然我發現家裡附近有好多木瓜樹，它們大多孤立生長於住家大樓、路旁等城市的縫隙中，不太具備農業產值，卻若無其事地出現在台北的各個角落。⁣⁣⁣⁣我開始尋找這些木瓜樹的蹤跡和歷史，發現它們都是由日本人於殖民時期（1895-1945）期間從夏威夷帶來，因為島嶼的氣候條件，讓木瓜長得非常鮮甜，極具農產價值，便開始系統化的大量種植。然而相較於香蕉、鳳梨，木瓜並不是當時代表的作物，但因為生長條件（腹地、土壤品質）並不像香蕉、鳳梨那麼高，所以得以成為充斥在台灣各個角落的頑皮果樹。⁣⁣⁣⁣類似的存在，但更「官方」一點的就是椰子樹。當時日本政府在市政廳、各大車站代表性地種下，為了讓台灣看起來更有「南洋風情」，那些椰子並非土生土長。這樣回頭一看，殖民歷史的痕跡其實充斥在我們的生活周遭，成為了我們的日常。我常想這些木瓜見證世代、政權、統治者的交替，究竟是以什麼樣的心情生活在這個島上？而外來及本土、原始及現代、原生及被殖民，這些界線又在哪呢？⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣本書分為三個部分：⁣⁣⁣⁣第一部「持續顯影的古代木瓜篇」是我在爬梳木瓜樹歷史檔案的時候，看到令我拍案叫絕的圖像資料記錄。⁣⁣⁣⁣第二部「遊牧中的城市木瓜篇」則是在台灣的各個角落拍到的木瓜樹，它們與建築、鋼筋混泥土共生的狀態。⁣⁣⁣⁣第三部「流轉中的藍白帆布方塊以及木瓜的自畫像」是在進行一系列的圖繪，有很多的「雜質」，藍白帆布是台灣常見的工業用帆布，防雨防風，時常可在路上看見。這個篇章更像是我個人在回憶、影像、日常之間穿梭的飄浮狀態。⁣⁣⁣⁣10.5 x 14.8 cm, B/W300pagesISBN :978-626-97804-1-9TraditionalChinese, EnglishFirst edition of 300February 2024"
Architecture of the Indimensionable,//3ssstudios.com/cdn/shop/files/AotI_1_1080x1530.png?v=1748206086,https://3ssstudios.com/collections/publications/products/architecture-of-the-indimensionable,Familiars Strangers,"Architects are nothing if not prodigious dimensioners of space. Their drawings take the unruly world and submit it to the disciplinary hand of metrology: twenty foot column bays, sixteen inches on center between studs, details specified to the millimeter. All that dimensioning serves a purpose. These carefully orchestrated measures form an inside and an outside; follow the seal of a window detail, nothing is getting past that line. Or so architects like to think. But as even the most casual of horror fans knows, such security is only ever an illusion: the more pristine your house in the suburbs, the more ghastly is its past; despite your barricades, the ghouls are smashing through the windows; and that dead body you’ve hidden beneath your floorboards will rise up to haunt your dreams.For despite architects’ allegiance to the hard logic of lines and tape measures, there is an indimensionable aspect to space—and in the indimensionable, not all is as it seems. A door is not just a door but a creaky threshold between worlds. A corridor does more than cut into a building’s rentable space, it provides passage for who knows how many unwanted travelers. Turn the light on in your basement, the darkness is gone but not its undead inhabitants. What do you see there, lurking in the boiler room? Rulers aren’t useful for charting out the indimensionable; instead one must pay attention to gut feelings. And arm hairs. Are they standing straight? That shadowy corner may have just inexplicably become a Hellmouth, you better get out of this building quickly, its plans have changed.This book explores these horrific spatial unknowns. It gathers together a collection of essays, interviews and drawings sourced from experts in the indimensionable: haunted house designers, ghost hunters, horror writers and those rare architectural practitioners who aren’t afraid to cast their eyes towards terrors they cannot meter.

Haunting of the Penthouse,//3ssstudios.com/cdn/shop/files/HotP_1_1080x1530.png?v=1748204822,https://3ssstudios.com/collections/publications/products/haunting-of-the-penthouse,Familiars Strangers,"Recording technologies, like enclosed spaces, promise to safeguard their contents from the ravages of the outside world. Sound waves, rather than leveling out into oblivion, are inscribed into wax, to be retrieved, self-equal, at a later date. Of course, white noise and other sonic oddities render pure preservation a quixotic goal; a message, altered via the imperfections of the arts of recording, is inevitably different upon its playback than at its first utterance.Not everyone, however, sees these distortions as meaningless errors. Paranormal investigators tend to treat failures of transmission as messages in their own right: to them, splotches on digital photographs are spiritual bodies and radio static eldritch screeds. Notably, these investigators also see evidence of the beyond in failures of homeliness: the first sign that a house is haunted, many ghost hunters argue, is simply that its inhabitants feel uncomfortable. What to make of this collapse between the errors of communication technologies and the errors of architecture?In 2018, seeking an answer to this question, Familiars Strangers invited a team of paranormal investigators to examine a prototypically haunted space: a locked attic room—or, to be specific, the locked penthouse atop the Paul Rudolph-designed Yale School of Architecture (Rudolph Hall).The Haunting of the Penthousenarrates this night and its frightful discoveries, the most notable of which may be that the figure-ground reversal of paranormal investigators—who listen not to signal but to noise—has much to teach architectural analysts. In this light, Rudolph Hall can be defined as much by its intended program as it can by the ways in which it serves as a framework for counter-programmatic acts: revolutionary student demands, arson, amatory misuses of space, and all the other noise for which Rudolph Hall inadvertently serves as channel.familiars books #2Sewn binding, 192 pages. 4.25 x 7 inches.published: 18 July 2021Table of ContentsGrounds for GhostsMatthew WagstaffeThere are some very strange spaces in Rudolph’s buildingsInterview with Timothy RohanArt and Architecture Building, Yale UniversityVincent ScullyChronolgy of Paul RudolphVery warm on the insideGrounds for Ghosts Image SupplementView this post on InstagramA post shared by Nocaut LLC (@nocautllc)"
Suburbs Poster Series,//3ssstudios.com/cdn/shop/files/Laura_1_1080x1530.png?v=1748204522,https://3ssstudios.com/collections/publications/products/suburbs-poster-series,Familiars Strangers,"Although the postwar American suburb presents itself as the paragon of normalcy, horror makers have long suspected that beneath its manicured lawns lie all sorts of hidden sins. Almost as soon as Levitt & Sons set up their supply chains, Shirley Jackson’s The Road Through the Wall imagined suburbia as a small-minded murderous enclave. Then came Carrie’s high school horrors, Carpenter’s wordless knife-wielder, Craven’s dream-invading psycho, and Laura Palmer’s interdimensional domestic tormentor. Of course, eventually the general public caught up with these horror maestros as the suburb’s crimes—the environmental footprint of its asphalt and automobiles, the “problem with no name” plaguing its housewives, the exclusionary FHA loans underlying its sunshiney sameness—became common knowledge. Scary movies, however, were the canaries in the coal mine, sounding the alarm long before anyone else took notice.If horror directors have these intuitive powers, what of their location scouts? For it is only the prescient eye of the location scout that designates otherwise ordinary suburban houses as host to narrative terrors. This poster series seeks to discover what physical properties deem a house fit for playing such a dark role. Can we read suburbia’s sins in its facade design? Did the makers of the suburbs mass-produce evil mystical geometries alongside inequality? Is suburbia’s rot communicable via elevation? Only through formal analysis can we discover the frightening answers.#1Michael Myer’s HouseHalloween, 1976, D: John Carpenter#2Laura Palmers’s HouseTwin Peaks, 1990, D: David LynchPoster - Twice FoldPublisher: Familiars StrangersPaper: NewsprintDimension: 4.625 x 7 x .75 inPages: Double SidedProcess: Offset PrintColor: Black"

Gilbert was on the way to New York City to sell a line of magic-trick kits he had designed when he noticed a series of steel structures being erected around his train. The New Haven-New York line was transitioning from steam to electric power and these steel girders held the wires through which the current was to reach the locomotive. Inspiration struck: rather than designing kits for the mastery of illusions, Gilbert would instead create toys for the mastery of this emerging infrastructure. Specifically, he designed the Erector Set, a construction toy that contained all the components of the catenary lines in miniature. In playing with the Erector Set’s model trusses and girders, Gilbert believed, a young boy would come to learn the principles of his new electromechanical world and consequently grow up to be a productive contributor to his society.Not all of Gilbert’s customers, however, were able to translate their mastery of construction toys to the messy realities of actual life.The Fall of Erector Towerexamines those Erector aficionados who grew up not to become engineers or architects but toy collectors. These are the individuals who misread the model as reality and remained within the hermetically sealed world of their childhood playthings. If Gilbert hoped his customers would become captains of industry, enacting their visions upon the earth, these individuals instead limit their constructions to inconsequential fantasy realms; their structures always remain miniature and are only ever unveiled on online message boards or upon folding tables at Erector conventions. But in light of the present state of the planet—rendered ruinous and chaotic by the runaway effects of industrialization—might it be the case that Gilbert’s vision of mastery was the true fantasy?16 pages, 22.75 x 28 inches.published: Nov 2023"

While Talbott’s thesis remains elusive, we watch on as the four horsemen of history, identity, style, and building technology emerge from the darkened plumes of primeval Europe to spread across the suburbs of America.

This network is a series of ecological corridors promoted by the European Union, created to preserve fauna, flora and biodiversity. It is a transnational communication system that goes beyond the border policies of each state, and puts ecological logic first. Bridges are some of the most important infrastructures in the network, since they make it easier for animals to overcome architectural barriers such as motorways and roads. At the same time, multiple fences and security cameras monitor and follow their movements, casting doubt on their apparent freedom of movement. The series includes landscape views of natural spaces and photographs of viaducts and other constructions, as well as snapshots of animals captured by surveillance cameras installed by researchers. This work explores the tensions that emerge from the power that human beings try to exert over nature. To do so, the author analyses the contradictory relationships between infrastructure construction, policies and freedom of movement, and nature conservation.17 x 24 cm / 288 p / softcover / ills colourText by Taco Hidde Bakker, James Bridle, Daniele De Luigi, Gian Piero Frassinelli, Serenella Iovino, Hélène Soubelet, Vitaliano TrevisanTranslation by Sabrina Fountain, Marilena LucchiniEnglish, Italian"
Costruzione dell'Universo: Artists’ Magazines and Publications after Marcel Duchamp,//3ssstudios.com/cdn/shop/files/CU1_1080x1530.png?v=1748194508,https://3ssstudios.com/collections/publications/products/costruzione-delluniverso,"Emanuele De Donno, Amedeo Martegani","Costruzione dell'Universo: Artists’ Magazines and Publications after Marcel Duchampis a research project that gathers artists’ magazines and publications by various artists who were active in the realm of “periodical and irregular” printed matter from the 1950s to the present day, beginning with of the work of the visionary artist Marcel Duchamp. This significant and hitherto overlooked sector of artistic production explores the dimension of the newspaper and magazine as an artistic medium. The selection includes extremely rare, a-periodic, and extraordinary printed items, “sensitive” publications in which the artist first handedly draws and designs the cover, the inner pages, the image sequence, or conceives the overall form of the object as a unique, yet replicable work. The publication in this context is sometimes transformed into an open and collective container, capable of engaging and coordinating multiple artists in the same layout or across different issues. The title “Construction of the Universe” points out to the fundamental and pioneering role of the early 20th-century avant-garde movement, referencing the 1915 Manifesto “Futurist Reconstruction of the Universe”, the notorious artistic manifesto that was initially released as a flyer and resembled newspaper layout. The 1950s (when our research for this book began) saw a significant rise of a utopian perspective in which artists, finally liberated from the existential weight of world conflicts, often envisioned the creation of a new society, free of relics and debris, made of travelling architectures and wide open spaces, new languages, and characterized by a deep longing for emptiness, a thrust toward the brightness of the future and the cosmos.a+mbookstore & Viaindustriae PublishingEdited by Emanuele De Donno, Amedeo MarteganiPublished on the occasion of the exhibition of the same title at the CIAC in FolignoSupported by Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Foligno352 pp.17×24 cmita/en2024ISBN 979-1281232075"

When Gustafsson started making self-portraits in 2012, he was looking for an alternative way of making photographs and wanted to question the issues of authorship associated with traditional photography. Discovering that Finland’s traffic and weather cameras snap photos every 12 minutes, storing them online for 24 hours, Gustafsson made a journey across the country, positioning himself in front of these outdoor cameras. The results are haunting images that capture the essence of solitude. Utilizing over 700 roadside cameras scattered throughout Finland, Gustafsson embraced the lack of control inherent in this process. Spending a week each month living in his car, he traversed the nation, becoming a ghostly presence amidst the tranquil landscapes captured by the automated cameras.230 x 210 mm / 400 pages / softcover / design by Tuomas Kortteinen / isbn 978-90-833459-9-4"

Looking at it now, in the 2020s, this focus makes perfect sense. The diverse contributions inThese Birds of Temptationinterrogate the role of art and poetry in times of ecological collapse and reflect on how birds play a crucial role in our understanding of the world and the earth. Birds are not treated as passive objects but as multi-dimensional beings with inherited and unfolding “life ways,” a concept introduced by environmental philosopher and fellow bird friend, Thom van Dooren.Made possible by the Schering Stiftung.intercalations6...is a queer refrain, populated with both acoustical lines of flight and the sorrows of captivity, wherein the reader-as-exhibition-viewer learns that the adventure of ornithology is as preoccupied with the evolutionary meaning of allopreening among avifauna as it is with their taxonomical domination.──With contributions creating a kaleidoscopic murmuration of minor ornithologies, including pieces on feathers, flight, song, loss, escape, and evasion, as well as a series of poetic reflections, short stories, and theoretical reflections on birds from Aristotle to Anaïs Nin, among many others.Edited by Anna-Sophie Springer & Etienne Turpin.With contributions by Eddie Bartley, Ari Bayuaji, Bik Van der Pol, David Bonter, Xavi Bou, Tiffany Bozic, Lêna Bùi, Bertolt Brecht, Wallace Craig, Mark Dion, Andreas Doepke, Jimmie Durham, Anne Geene, Sophia Gräfe, Mary Ellen Hannibal, Nina Katchadourian, Bernie & Kat Krause, Barbara Marcel, Anaïs Nin, Arjan de Nooy, Megan Prelinger, John Paul Ricco, David Rothenberg, Juliana Spahr, Bruno Schulz, Anna-Sophie Springer, Frank Steinheimer, Yoko Tawada, Anna Tsing, Etienne Turpin, and Francesca Woodman.

A Complicated Organism: The Architecture of the Global Moravian Network 1722–1922,//3ssstudios.com/cdn/shop/files/ACO_1_1080x1530.png?v=1748195867,https://3ssstudios.com/collections/publications/products/a-complicated-organism-the-architecture-of-the-global-moravian-network-1722-1922,Jasper Ludewig,"The modern Moravians are notable as an independent religious movement that for over two centuries developed a highly interconnected global network of settlements and mission stations. By 1800, three times as many Moravian missionaries were being sent into the world as all other Protestant missionary organizations combined and close to twenty carefully planned Moravian communities had been established on either side of the Atlantic Ocean. A century later, the Moravian world comprised hundreds of settlements in every continent except for Antarctica.A Complicated Organismexamines the role of architecture and spatial thinking in enabling the modern Moravians to perform their unique brand of global organizational governance. It explores the development of their sprawling network of settlements in relation to concepts of religious and social order, practices of archiving, systems of communication and media, discourses of humanitarianism and expertise, and colonial regimes of control and subjugation.Throughout, this volume argues that architectural production always remained inseparable from these wider strategic objectives, providing the Moravians with a flexible yet coherent model for establishing similar conditions in diverse environments around an increasingly connected world.Edited by Center for Critical Studies in Architecture (CCSA)Design:hla.studio, LeipzigSoftcover, 10,5 × 15 cm,132 pages10 color and black and white imagesEnglishPublished by M BOOKS, Weimar1st Edition, 2024ISBN 978-3-944425-34-4"

Diversion,//3ssstudios.com/cdn/shop/files/1_05c672df-5eff-47f1-adfa-7f555b8a38a6_1080x1530.png?v=1746680863,https://3ssstudios.com/collections/publications/products/diversion,Asad Raza,"The river is a key protagonist in the planetary water cycle—channeling earth's circulation of water from mountain to brook, from ocean and to cloud. As a source of energy flows, fertility, and new life, the river is often understood as a powerful deity or person, holding historical, economical, socio-political, and emotional importance. In response to Portikus' unique location on Frankfurt's Main island, artist Asad Raza's new workDiversionreflects on the many facets that rivers carry. In an evocative waterscape that spans the entire exhibition space, visitors encounter a continuous stream of the Main diverted through the gallery and flowing back to the current.At the heart of Raza's practice is the creation of experiences and dialogues. InDiversion, the audience is invited to interact with, dip in, and drink purified water from the river. As in many of the artist's works, human exchange is an integral part of this piece. Custodians, who Raza cast on site, wander with the visitor, explaining scientific facts, telling stories, and carrying out daily rituals, such as monitoring the water quality, analyzing its development, filtering, and remineralizing quantities of it. By bringing together the processual and the relational, Raza emphasizes in this piece the interdependence of humans and their environment.The notion of transformation—of knowledge and substance—is highlighted by various materials used in the gallery and by actions occurring throughout the exhibition. Inspired by the image of the river delta, all elements are connected like arteries and feeding on each other.Diversionforms an ecosystem, which the artist describes as a metabolism—the synergy of human, plant, and mineral life. Using common materials, such as newspapers, picnic tables, pipes and pitchers, Raza imagines an environment of collective memory, creating a place of gathering and contemplation. In this sense, the title,Diversion, alludes both the literal detour of the Main through Portikus and to the urgency of steering away from the course.Designed byStudio Pandanand co-published by X Artists' Books and Portikus, this newspaper includes contributions byLiberty Adrien,Arhun Aksakal,Sophia Al-Maria,Shane Anderson,Carina Bukuts,Keren Cytter,Manthia Diawara,Emily Dickinson,Dan Graham,Rufus Hale,Catalina Imizcoz,Prem Krishnamurthy,Wolfram Lotz,Adéla Součková,Joe Stahlmann,Elsa Stanyer,Bones Tan Jones, and more.Asad Raza(b. 1974 in Buffalo, US) rejects disciplinary boundaries in his work, which conceives of art as a metabolic, active experience. Using actions and processes such as soil-making, tennis, and horticulture, his projects create encounters within and beyond the exhibition. His works have been realized by institutions including the Whitney Museum of American Art (2017), the Lahore Biennale (2018), Kaldor Public Art Projects (2019), Gropius Bau (2020), the Serpentine Galleries (2020), Urbane Kunst Ruhr (2021), West Den Haag (2022), Grand Union (2021–2023) and the Front Triennial (2022).Mathew Haleis an artist, writer and curator based in Los Angeles and Berlin.

Edited and published by the group of avant-garde artists who called themselves Bloodless Murder, this obscure magazine reminiscent of Kruchenykh’s early Futurist publications, was printed in a very limited edition.Almost completely unknown to scholars and curators of the avant-garde, theBloodless Murder[Beskrovnoe ubiystvo] group included artists such as Vera Ermolaeva, Olga Leshkova, Nikolay Lapshin and Mikhail Le Dentu. Their “anarchist” publications and actions were intended to “insult and offend” bourgeois morality. The “Albanian” issue targeted the nationalist ideas of their old friend, the journalist Janko Lavrin, who later on became an internationally known literary historian.In this volume, we publish the entire issue of the magazine with an extensive commentary by the researcher and curatorAlexandra Strukova, who unearthed these documents from the RGALI archives. The volume also includes a brief retrospective note and two letters from Olga Leshkova, one of the magazine’s editors, to Zdanevich in 1924.Inspired by the magazine, Zdanevich wrote the Zaum playYanko I, King of Albania, which was performed in December 1916. Here we include an essay by the scholar and librarian Andrei Krusanov, who reconstructs the background and atmosphere of this historic performance.

The report offers a scathing takedown of Russian writers whom he accuses of commodifying and watering down the avant-garde discoveries.

In editing the output, Bernstein made many deletions of poems and lines but added no new language.The art of poetry has always been an exploration of the “human condition”, the expression of the self often producing cultural commentary. But what happens when the poet is not just human? This question lies at the heart of a singular new collection entitled “Poetry Has No Future Unless It Comes to an End: Poems of Artificial Intelligence,” the result of a collaboration between artist Davide Balula and poet legend Charles Bernstein.While generated by a bespoke A.I. model predating more generic tools like ChatGPT, this collection retains the voice and personality of the esteemed poet Charles Bernstein, carving a new path, providing an exciting exploration of the intersection of literature, technology, and art, making this book a testament to the enduring power of collaboration between humans and machines. In the continuation of Davide Balula’s A.I. Generated Instructions started in 2018, Balula and Bernstein continue to shape the burgeoning field of synthetic literature, offering a glimpse into what the future of poetry might look like, making sure poetry enthusiasts now also include robots.Charles Bernstein(1950, NY, USA), a leading figure in contemporary poetry, is widely regarded as one of the most influential living poets. He has devoted his career to pushing the boundaries of traditional forms of poetry and criticism. A scholar and educator, he is also the founder of numerous pioneering poetry platforms, in print, tape, and online (starting when the web was still in its infancy), servicing the digital preservation and dissemination of carefully curated creative writing to a wide audience.The practice of artistDavide Balula(1978, Viseu, Portugal) blends the organic with the synthetic, encouraging viewer participation and enlisting the natural environment as active agents in his work.

Even at such a remove, we thought it was important to retrace the fundamental stages of this event through critical essays, images of the works and installations, and the calendar of performances and poetry readings. The reason is simple: despite the undeniable weight of images in today’s world, a keen interest in writing — rather surprisingly — has recently become a hallmark of many young artists’ work. They use writing as a tool to understand the world and as the cornerstone of a critical method, analyzing the present and creating a performative, politically engaged language.From Concrete to Liquid to Spoken Worlds to the Wordexplored the emancipation of language through historical and contemporary positions, from the earliest typographic and sound works of concrete poets to poetic experiments in the digital era. This diverse exhibition was accompanied by a series of readings, performances, and screenings revealing the porosity between art and poetry. Poetry readings and recitals in museums, performances centered on the importance of the text and its recitation, videos where poetic language takes on a role that rivals the visual component: the art of our time appears to be deeply and intimately rooted in words.The program of the Centre d’Art Contemporain Genève, while tracing this link between word and image to the concrete poetry of the 1960s and ’70s, tried on the one hand to examine this renewed artistic interest in the word, and on the other to show how the web and social media are introducing new ways of making poetry. The underlying aim was to explore how art and poetry shape each other in an increasingly interconnected world through ongoing, rhapsodic communication.Edited by Andrea BelliniTexts by Andrea Bellini, Mathieu Copeland, Carla Demierre, Brian Droitcour, Karl Holmqvist, Kenneth Goldsmith and Quinn LatimerDesign by Robert Huber2022, English, softcover, 178 pages, 16.9 x 22.4 cmISBN 979-12-80579-23-2*Awarded ""The most beautiful Swiss books"" in 2023"

The book brings together hundreds of archival materials from photo albums, rare and invaluable oral histories, creative writings, and interviews with scholars. Over nearly a year of editing, we felt like revisiting 20th-century San Francisco and Cuba, tracing history through the neons of Chinatown and the echoes of Cantonese opera. For the dancers and performers documented in this book, their bodies act as living archives; their memories and unspoken emotions may be concealed in their steps, fingertips, and gazes.Additionally, the design duo Studio Pianpian He and Max Harvey transformed the books into a vessel of collective memory through their design.

Stinkhorn: How Nature's Most Foul-Smelling Mushroom Can Change the Way We Listen,//3ssstudios.com/cdn/shop/files/01_1827c3fa-994b-40b4-ab13-10fe4e1d22e2_1080x1530.png?v=1745434472,https://3ssstudios.com/collections/publications/products/stinkhorn-how-natures-most-foul-smelling-mushroom-can-change-the-way-we-listen,Siôn Parkinson,"The stinkhorn mushroom is one of the weirdest wonders of the fungal world, certainly the smelliest. Ever since it was described by a Dutch doctor in a sixteenth-century pamphlet, the stinkhorn has been reported to emit odors resembling damp earth, dung, rotting cheese, decaying flesh, and even semen. It also happens to look like a phallus, bursting out of a subterranean egg to poke above the ground, where it lures insects towards its slimy, fetid cap. InStinkhorn, artist, musician, and writer Siôn Parkinson asks: What can the pervasive stench of this mushroom and the droning noise of the flies compelled towards it reveal about how sounds and smells are combined in the imagination?A heady mix of natural history, science writing, musicology, philosophy of the senses, and illness memoir, Parkinson uses examples of so-called bad smells to argue for a theory of Stink as a kind of “smelling sound.” Alongside images and insights from the author’s search for stinkhorn fungi in nature, the book expands upon the philosophy of listening to consider the role of the nose and the “nasal imaginary” in how we make sense of sound.In this treatise on malodors and how they can transform the conditions for listening, Parkinson considers John Cage’s silent fungal forays, Brian Eno’s compositions with perfumes, the hum note of a vibrating bell, the “eggy” odor of space, and the author’s own hallucinated stench as the result of an epileptic seizure. What links these disparate ideas and sensory experiences can be found in a single encounter with a ripe stinkhorn mushroom.Includes 16-page insert of a facsimile of the Neo-Latin–English translation ofThe Description of the Phallusby Hadrianus Junius, translated by Caroline Spearing.17×24 cm, 208 pages, 8 color & 48 b/w ill, hardcover with dust jacketISBN 978-1-915609-27-4Design: Stuart Bertolotti-Bailey"

The tenth volume in the Critical Spatial Practice series responds to the urgent need for alternative modes of evidentiary production by introducing an innovative system of architectural drawing and notation.Today, most Western legal forums utilized by Indigenous communities for recognition of their rights continue to employ evidentiary rules that do not allow for Native truths to be accepted as “reliable” evidence. When tribes are asked to provide proof of their traditional connection to the land, what Western legal forums accept as documentation does not truly represent or respect tribal culture and traditional formats of knowledge transfer.Kolowratnik’s research focuses on the double bind Pueblo communities in the American Southwest are confronted with when they become involved in a legal effort to reclaim and protect ancestral lands, since the process of producing evidence runs counter to their structural organization around oral history and cultural secrecy. The spatial notational systems developed by Kolowratnik with the support of Hemish people, members of Jemez Pueblo in northern New Mexico, and presented in this volume are an attempt to produce evidentiary documentation that speaks Native truths while respecting demands on secrecy. These systems also attempt to instigate a dialogue where there currently is none, deconstructing the fixed opposition between secrecy and disclosure within Western legal systems.Edited by Nikolaus Hirsch, Markus MiessenFeaturing artwork by Trevor PaglenWith contributions by Elsa Stamatopoulou, Pah-Tow-Wei Paul TosaNovember 2019, English10.5×15 cm, 150 pages, 39 b/w ill., softcover with dust jacketISBN 978-3-95679-097-3Series: Critical Spatial PracticeDesign: Zak Group"

Like some of Bolzoni's previous projects, this work is in the shape of a book of images and has a profoundly introspective nature.Conceptually, the book stems from the investigation of the accumulation of things and images, represented by photos of rubbish, consumed and wasted objects. However, in a world that produces everything in excess, including immaterial items, even images become the extension of this concept. Bolzoni operates a careful appropriation of existing images from various sources and the self- appropriation of photos previously taken by the artist. This element can be almost seen as self-inflicted criticism because even the artist is not immune to this hyper-production. Bolzoni, in other words, does not cast himself out of the universe that he coldly analyses and documents.Accumulo is an organised repository of excess, the metaphor of what a Lacanian would call ""surplus-enjoyment"". This aspect is made evident by the appropriation of SlavojŽižek's essay ""The Varieties of Surplus"" (another one, albeit explicitly approved by the philosopher). It is essential to specify thatŽižek's piece lives in this book, not as a comment to Accumulo but as an ""Other"" caught in a dialogue with the vast body of images. The appropriated essay is akin to a psychoanalyst, a professional listener of Bolzoni's proposition. It is ""Other"" and yet inextricable from the book.21,3 x 28cm"

Her expansive project,A Non-Coincidental Mirror, follows this line of inquiry, investigating two often-forgotten events in the cultural history of Global South solidarities: the Third World Filmmakers Meeting in Algiers in 1973 and its second iteration in Buenos Aires in 1974.Published on occasion of the exhibition of the same name, presented in the context of the artist’s 2022–2024 VLC Fellowship,A Non-Coincidental Mirroris the first monograph on Carmen Amengual and extensively examines the filmmakers’ meetings and their myriad aftermaths from an artistic and historiographical perspective. The book brings together a visual collage of Amengual’s research, film stills, and architectural models alongside a reflection on the trajectory of Amengual’s project by exhibition curatorsEriola PiraandRachel Vera Steinberg;an essay by film historianMariano Mestmancontextualizing cinematic Third-Worldism in the 1960s and 1970s; and a conversation between the artist and independent curator and writerNatasha Marie Llorenson shared political desires, loss, and utopian imagining in Algiers and Buenos Aires.The impetus forA Non-Coincidental Mirror, the first and second filmmakers’ meetings served as hubs where self-identified “third-world” filmmakers discussed the role of filmmaking in anticolonial struggles, made agreements, and strategized about how to produce and distribute films under dire political conditions. Drawing from an archive inherited from her mother, architect Malena Fernández—who had collaborated with the organizers of the Algiers meeting—Amengual embarked on a field investigation to follow the thread of these meetings across Algiers, Buenos Aires, and Rome. Tracing the thread of these forgotten events, Amengual seeks to reimagine a failed documentary project that the organizers attempted to make as part of the follow-up meeting in Argentina.Experimenting with fragmentation, storytelling, documentary forms, research methodologies, and architectural design, Amengual’s project does not set out to uncover truths or present a historical account of these meetings so much as to engage with their legacy, residue, and significance in the present, be they real or imagined.Carmen Amengual: A Non-Coincidental Mirror is published on occasion of the exhibition of the same name, co-presented by the Vera List Center and Smack Mellon at Smack Mellon, Brooklyn, NY, December 2024–February 2025, as the culmination of Amengual’s 2022–2024 VLC Fellowship.Edited by Re’al Christian and Eriola PiraDesigned by Jacob Lindgren2025Softcover, 14*21.5 cm, 79 p.Edition of 500"

Over the course of this yearlong curatorial framework, we looked at our founding ethos and interrogated how the urban storefront—even in its most humble form—can enable carescapes, provide refuge and a sense of belonging by maintaining an intimate social character embedded in its local context.In a city of skyscrapers, where expansion happens vertically, the ground floor tends to be overlooked. Storefront, however, has always maintained a unique relationship with the sidewalk. Our iconic facade, with its twelve rotating panels that open the gallery to the street, creates a permeable threshold between public and private realms. This relationship with the ground floor was also a motivating force behind On the Ground, allowing us to showcase diverse artistic explorations and dialogues on the essential role storefronts play in cultivating public life and strengthening the city’s social fabric.This reader extends some of these conversations into print and well beyond New York City. Its aim is to serve as a resource and experimental space to further dissect the intricacies of our evolving city by offering critical essays, interviews, poetry, and other visual contributions that expand on what we have collectively learned throughout the year. Positioning the ground floor as a marker of social, political, and economic transformation through the voice of several collaborators and interlocutors with whom we engaged over the course of the program, this publication applies various lenses.On the Ground is the collaborative work of 113 collaborators, and it unfolded over the past two years.On the Ground ContributorsBasel Abbas, Ruanne Abou-Rahme, Leila Adu, OlaRonke Akinmowo, Adam Anabosi, Elias Anastas, Yousef Anastas, Raimundo Atal, Germane Barnes, Alvaro Barrington, Francisca Benítez, Jenna Bliss, Eric Booker, Natalia Boumatar, Cudelice Brazelton IV, Tom Burr, Sol Camacho, Jordan Carter, Emmy Catedral, Jesse LeCavalier, Mxtress Charlotte, Jamie Cheung, Yoshiko Chuma, Savitri D., Gabriela D’Addario, Nicholas Dawidoff, Danielle Dean, Ali Dineen, Keller Easterling, Levi Eichenstein, Ming Fay, Parker Fay, Ryan Foerster, Roger Francis, Roland Francis, Ricardo Gallo, Igancio Gatica, RJ Gitter, Zacarías González, Eduardo Pavez Goye, Chong Gu, Ilana Harris-Babou, Claudia Irizarry Aponte, Bella Janssens, Paolo Javier, Sebastijan Jemec, Steffani Jemison, David L.

Within its pages is a collection of materials that trace the evolution of her practice, including documentation of her situationist ceramics, research notes, ephemera, reading references, visual poems, and contributions from her father in the form of drawings and calligraphy. The book-making process itself bears witness to Lu’s journey of reconciliation, exploring how her personal and artistic identity finds a place within a practice that defies easy categorization.Lu’s projects over the years have spanned a wide spectrum of mediums and settings. Highlights includeBoat DateandSleep Date(with iterations presented atNars Art Foundation,Macau International Art Biennale 2023, andCreative Time HQin New York); a series of participatory performances and collaborations during her residency atSpecial Special; the screening of her film,A Girl Sings Along Without Knowing the Words, held in a dim sum hall in Flushing; and, more recently, the group exhibitionHome-O-Stasisat a mini-mall in Flushing.

Through this exhibition, the curatorial team hopes to share with the public Signer’s memories, that were formerly boxed up and preserved in archives and databases. Signer has never been a fan of large-scale events and artworks, and he intentionally avoids talking about himself. Indeed, at documenta 8, when he was very much in the art world limelight, he may have felt the level of attention was too much. Signer is an artist who always contemplates his relation to the world, and who always lives in self-reflection. He existed – in the sense that his artworks and their dimensions are deeply related to the world; yet he never exists – in the sense that part of his artworks are presented in real time in front of an audience. He even deliberately wipes away his own traces, or his artworks’ connections to the world, and stays apart, in an individual state of being. This kind of ‘disconnection’ does not exist as a blunt fracturing from the world. Instead, it is a process of dissolving into daily life. It is clear that Signer’s work has not changed due to shifting politics, economics, or even time. He maintains simple methods of expressing his understanding of the world, re-discovering the world through materialised forms and through experiments with the spiritual and material.Roman Signer’s first touring exhibition to China is kindly supported by Museum of Contemporary Art of CAA, CAFA Art Museum, Art Museum of GAFA, OCT Art and Design Gallery (Shenzhen), MAN Nuoro Art Museum (Italy), Wti, and Chronus Art Center. Special thanks go to Mr. Yang Jingsong, Mr. Qiu Zhijie, Mr. Wang Huangsheng, Mr. Wang Chunchen, Mr. Hu Bin, Mr. Feng Feng, Mr. Lorenzo Giusti for their curatorial support, and Mr. Zhang Qinghong for his generous support.The exhibition is also supported by: documenta Archiv Kassel, Helmhaus, Swiss Arts Council, Chronus Art Center, Kunstgiesserei St.Gallen etc. Generous support also comes from Corinne Schatz, David Signer, Karin Stengel, Simon Maurer, Barbara Signer, Michael Bodenmann, Uli Sigg, Josef Felix Müller, Peter Zimmermann, Reto Thüring, Rachel Withers, Max Wechsler, Geneviève Loup, Felix Lehner, and Aline Feichtinger.Publication and copyright support come from Vexer Verlag, graphic design is provided by Yu Qiongjie with Transwhite Studio, translation and copy-editing is provided by Eva Luedi, Wang Pan, Iris Xinru Long, and Susannah Worth.On November 3rd, Roman Signer will realize his first work of sculpture to have been produced in China – the result of a commission from Ms. Sunny Sun and LUXELAKES·A4 Art Museum, Chengdu, Sichuan.The project’s development has been widespread, proceeding via Hangzhou, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Sardegna (Italy), and finally Chengdu, where Signer completes this unique sculptural piece.Signer’s endeavour begins with the water cycle active around the viewers: reflecting on the ephemeral nature of time, we meet moments of uncertainty, subtlety, dynamics, and humour.Water from the lake shall return to it, eventually.""-Li ZhenhuaA project founded by Li Zhenhua, Zhang Qinghong and Roman Signer in 2014.Author: Li Zhenhua, Qiu Zhijie, Corinne Schatz, Hu Bin, Feng FengEditor: Cai LiyuanDesign: Wang Nana, Ge TingtingTranslation: Long Xingru, Liu XiaoProofreading: Barbara Signer, Edward SandersonLanguage: Chinese, English185 x 260 mm, 73 p.Publication Date: November 2018Print run: 500《罗曼·西格纳（Roman Signer）影像 1975—1989与现在》文献画册，收录了策展人李振华关于罗曼·西格纳影像展览的梳理文章，以及邱志杰、科瑞尼·莎茨（Corinne Schatz）、胡斌、冯峰等策展人、艺术家及批评家的重要评述，同时将艺术家从1975年与Bernard Tagwerker的联合项目《桑蒂斯与博登湖》到2018年在成都由麓湖·美术馆委托创作的《椅子》等作品一一呈现，其中还包括艺术家在1987年卡塞尔文献展、1999年威尼斯双年展上的重要作品。该画册为麓湖·A4美术馆十周年特别文献画册，限量500册。介绍罗曼的工作始于对他作品的点滴认识，希望能通过展览共享这些被保藏的记忆。罗曼通常不喜欢过于庞大的现场和作品，他甚至有些故意的避免过多的谈自己。哪怕是在1987年卡塞尔文献展上所出的风头，也许让他有悔意，这与一个艺术家不断和这个世界调整的关系，以及自我投射的个人。他存在过，与作品的大小有关吗？他没有存在，他的部分作品发生在无人之处，或故意抹掉那些和世界的联系，他一直保持着一种个人的状态，有些作品也很自然的被混同于他的日常生活。很显然罗曼的工作，并没有因为时间、经济或是政治的情况而发生改变，他通过最简单的方式，阐释自己对这个世界的理解，通过对物质和精神——物化的尝试，去发现这个世界。罗曼在中国的系列展览得到了中国美术学院美术馆、中央美术学院美术馆、广州美术学院美术馆、深圳华美术馆、意大利努奥罗美术馆、网庭、新时线媒体艺术中心等机构的支持。感谢杨劲松、邱志杰、王璜生、王春辰、胡斌、冯峰、Lorenzo Giusti的策展支援，感谢张庆红先生对这个项目的支持。对这个项目的支持机构还有：卡塞尔文献展文献库、Helmhaus艺术馆、瑞士文化基金会、新时线媒体艺术中心、圣加仑艺术铸造公司（Kunstgiesserei St.Gallen）等。支持项目的还有Corinne Schatz，David Signer，Karin Stengel，Simon Maurer，Barbara Signer，Michael Bodenmann，Uli Sigg，Josef Felix Müller，Peter Zimmermann，Reto Thüring，Rachel Withers，Max Wechsler，吉纳维夫·卢普（Geneviève Loup），菲利克斯·莱纳（Felix Lehner），阿莲·菲施汀格（Aline Feichtinger）等。罗曼的出版物版权支持来自Vexer Verlag，设计来自非白工作室的虞琼洁和团队，翻译的朋友有林小发（Eva Luedi）、王盼、龙星如、Susannah Worth。罗曼的第一件在中国的雕塑作品，由孙莉女士和成都麓湖·A4美术馆委托创作，于2018年11月3日完成，伴随着这个系列展览在地缘上的挪移，项目经历杭州、北京、广州、深圳、意大利撒丁岛……在成都，最终罗曼的工作凝结成一个特别的雕塑，当水流从人头顶越过的时候，罗曼工作中贯穿始终：动态的、不确定的、微妙的、幽默的瞬间，借助时间的稍纵即逝得以再现。来自湖中的水，也必回到湖中。——李振华此项目由李振华、张庆红、罗曼·西格纳于2014年共同发起。"

This consumption extends beyond the market to academic and intellectual discourse. Treating Ainu people as mere academic topics and ideas leads to overlooking the history of racism and poverty resulting from colonialism, and the suffering and deaths of many Ainu people.Furthermore, when discussing the Ainu people and colonial structures, understanding the reality in binary terms such as insider/outsider, perpetrator/victim, colonizer/colonized can render invisible the voices and existence of those who do not fit into these dichotomies.In this issue, we interviewed mai ishihara, an anthropologist at the Center for Ainu and Indigenous Studies at Hokkaido University and herself of Ainu descent, on how to resist tokenization/encoding and consumption and think about decolonization regarding the reality that does not fit into the dichotomies.今日の日本社会では、アイヌの人びとや文化を、SDGs推進やダイバーシティ・環境問題への取り組みの中で記号化・商品化し、市場において消費する植民地主義的構造が存在しています。消費はマーケットの中のみならず、アイヌ文化や伝統を学術的や知的に考え論じる際にも、歴史的な差別や植民地主義による貧困、そしてその中でアイヌの人びとの身体が傷つけられ命が失われた事実を見過ごし、思想としてアイヌを消費してしまうことにも及びます。また、植民地主義について考える際に、殖民者／被植民者、当事者／非当事者、加害者／被害者といった二元論的なフレームワークで語ることにより、その二元論から抜け落ちてしまう人びとの生や複雑な現実が不可視化されてしまいます。「アイヌと脱／植民地化」と題したVol. 3では、北海道大学 アイヌ・先住民研究センター准教授で自身もアイヌの出自を持つ人類学者の石原真衣さんとともに、どのようにして記号化や消費に抗い、二元論的な構造に当てはまらない現実における脱植民地化を考えうるか、ということについて思考していきます。About the project /Decolonize Futuresとは“Decolonize Futures” is a ZINE project to open up the discussion of the deep history of colonialism and the need of decolonization in Japan and East Asia for the possibilities of plural futures.

It is no longer surprising to see the worsening situation of climate change. The environmental crisis extends beyond climate change. Human activities have caused the extinction of many species with an unprecedented speed, which is now called “sixth mass extinction.” Behind the history of the environmental crisis, there are culture, politics, and economy that have justified and progressed the environmental destruction. Through colonialism, people and the nature in the colonized countries and regions are turned into an exploitable “thing” or “resource,” and such discourse justified the historical destruction of the ecosystem worldwide.In Decolonize Futures Vol. 2 “Decolonization and the Environmental Crisis,” we organized interviews with scholars who criticize the colonialism lying beneath the environmental crisis and explore the possibility of alternative futures. With Yoshihiro Nakano (Rikkyo University) and Eiko Honda (Aarhus University), we will deep dive into the topics including the history of the decolonization movements, the alternative futures through degrowth perspective, and the importance of pluralizing the narratives of history.2023年は、観測史上最も暑い年でした。気候変動によって台風や豪雨の被害が年々悪化している状況が、もはや当たり前のように感じてしまいます。環境の危機は、気候変動だけではありません。地球上の様々な生物種が、類を見ない速さで絶滅している「第6の大量絶滅」に入ったと言われています。 環境破壊や気候変動が悪化してきた歴史の背景には、環境破壊を肯定し推し進めてきた経済や政治、そして文化があります。植民地主義を通じて、植民地の人々や自然を搾取可能な「モノ」とみなし、土地を征服し切り開いてきたことが歴史的な環境破壊へと繋がっていきました。Decolonize Futures Vol. 2「脱植民地化と環境危機」は、環境危機の根底にある植民地主義を批判し、オルタナティブな未来の可能性を研究する方々とのインタビューを収録した一冊となっています。 立教大学特任准教授の中野佳裕さんと、オーフス大学助教授の本田江伊子さんを招き、脱植民地化運動が様々な変化を遂げながら展開されてきた歴史、脱成長から考えるオルタナティブな未来の可能性、歴史をイデオロギー化せずに複数形の語りをすることの重要性といったトピックについて深掘ります。About the project /Decolonize Futuresとは“Decolonize Futures” is a ZINE project to open up the discussion of the deep history of colonialism and the need of decolonization in Japan and East Asia for the possibilities of plural futures.

Colonialism is lying beneath the inequalities in the world. Even though colonialism has ended in the form of physical occupation in many regions, a violent colonial system persisted through economic exploitation and cultural domination by Western nations and infiltrates our everyday lives. The colonial worldview is centered around Western culture and a hierarchy that assumes “White, (in Japan, Japanese) cis-hetero men” as most human while treating “women, LGBTQ+ people, people of color, non-Western indigenous people, etc” as inferior who deserve exploitation. Vol. 1 alerts to such reality and walks readers through how feminism, Anti-Racism, and Decolonization connect to each other. To think about how social issues intersect with the history of colonialism, we hosted a lecture with Dr. LaRose T. Parris, Associate Professor at CUNY, Lehman College. This issue is an archive of a dialogue between Professor Parris and the participants drawn to the topic of “decolonization” while living in contemporary Japanese society and discursive space.「家父長制、白人至上主義や人種差別。社会に存在する不平等や格差の原因は、植民地主義にあるのかもしれない。」 物理的な植民地支配が多くの地域で終わったにも関わらず、欧米諸国が行った経済的搾取や文化的な支配を通じて、暴力的な構造は今も私たちの生活に根付いています。 植民地主義の世界観では、欧米の文化が世界の中心であり、「シスヘテロ男性、白人（日本では人種的マジョリティである日本人）が最も人間らしい存在と見なされるヒエラルキーが生まれます。そして「女性／性的マイノリティ／有色人種の人々／非西洋の人々など」はヒエラルキーの下に位置付けられ、搾取され続けてきました。 Vol.1は、こうした現状に警鐘を鳴らし、フェミニズム、反人種差別がいかに脱植民地化と繋がるかを考える一冊です。 本号ではニューヨーク市立大学リーマン校のラローズ・T・パリス教授を招き、複数の社会課題が植民地主義と交差する様子に焦点を当てたレクチャーを行い、その講演を記事化しました。本文では、レクチャーや参加者との対話を可視化し、今の日本社会や言論空間において「脱植民地化」に関心を抱いた参加者と、ラローズ・T・パリス教授の対話の記録も紹介しています。About the project /Decolonize Futuresとは“Decolonize Futures” is a ZINE project to open up the discussion of the deep history of colonialism and the need of decolonization in Japan and East Asia for the possibilities of plural futures.

Young,"The culmination of meticulous research and intuitive experimentation, American multimedia artist and photographer J.A. Young’s first monograph,Of Fire, Far Shining, is a non-rational, starkly intimate body of work devoid of classical ordering principles.Using both personal photographs and public domain archival images as raw materials, Young radically decontextualizes and transmutes these forms, immersing the viewer in a world where the utility of the image is dissolved and new, evocative meanings can emerge.Through a layered process of dramatic recomposition, physical print manipulation, and rephotography, Young unravels an intensely emotional and associative narrative that explores what it feels like to live in an era marked by rampant militarization, technological hyper-violence, and unrelenting ecological devastation.21,5 x 27 cm portrait174 pagesB&W / HUV offset printingSections sewn, softcover bindingFirst edition of 150 copiesImages by J.A.

And how does one begin to untangle the paradoxes and dynamism of showers from their sleek facades?""Shower Thoughts"" is an artist book combining quirky social experiments, serious theories, and artwork documentation—all centered on the shower. Among its playful experiments, ""Shower Hotline"" is a toll-free mini sound archive where anyone can call to listen to anonymous shower recordings or leave their own. It invites callers to “shower” in a public space and explore the playful tension between private and public. ""Shower Perpetuus"" is an installation repurposing liquid CPU cooling systems to create unpredictable showers. As condensation forms and drips from chilled cooling blocks, participants experience a “shower” created by each other’s breaths.Moving beyond these experiments, the book examines the eco- and techno-political dimensions of showers as both personal experiences and networked systems, aiming to reveal how showers create the illusion of individual sterility while uncovering the infrastructure of that illusion. By drawing on post-digital aesthetics and science and technology studies, the book reframes our commonsense beliefs about autonomy, illustrating how repetitive bodily actions network isolated “users” into larger systems, much like digital networks, forming an unconscious community. Ultimately, the book explores the blurred boundaries between private and public, wet and dry, and individual and collective.Text by Ally Yanxiu LuoEdited by Vince WarneDesign by Sirui (Rui) Liao120 x 177 mm106 pagesSoftcoverEnglishISBN 979-889692120-2"

The meaning of such objects gets assigned silently, internally, often without any words being articulated, and yet when we explain their importance, it reveals so much about who we are. Elisabeth Smolarz approaches these objects as elements in a social and anthropological process. She visited 200 people in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia and spent an afternoon with them talking about the objects they had selected. In dialogue with these collaborators she then developed an installation of the individual objects—an arrangement that ultimately produces a portrait of the person. The photographic still lifes are accompanied by short texts by a range of writers who share their responses to these portraits.Elisabeth Smolarz is an artist, curator, and educator living and working in Queens. She is the founder/director of Spectral Lines.EDITOR: Michelle LevyDESIGNER: Merle Petsch240 pp. with 80 colour illustrationsthread-sewn hardcoverLeipzig July, 2022ISBN: 9783959055109Edition Number: 1Width: 23 cmLength: 28 cmLanguage(s): English"

Originating from a primordial drive to admire and emulate the beauty of the natural world, these practices bridge ancient rituals and modern expressions. From an aesthetic perspective, a portrait of humanity emerges, subjected to the beauty of the natural world, concentrated on the attempt to graspits ephemeral beauty, through practices that originated in antiquity and are now translated differently into the contemporary.2024224 pages, 21x29 cmCover paper with thick purple printEdition of 200 copiesPhotography & research: Clelia CadamuroArt direction: Chinzia CuciniBook cover design: Giulia BoccarossaBook design: Clelia Cadamuro, Giorgia CaboniISBN 978-88-946851-8-3"

And secondly, I try to stress the fact that the theory of gravity is a lot of nonsense.’ – Ivor Cutler, 1959Guy Bolongaro (born Crewe, 1978) studied sociology before moving to London to become a social worker. Around 2014, burnt out by work and frustrated by his attempts at making documentary films in his spare time, he began taking photographs as a form of ‘daily art therapy,’ making images on his lunch breaks and walks home from work. A few years after the birth of his first child he shifted focus from the public sphere to the family cosmos, turning attention from his walking routes to his domestic routines.Capturing the strange and vibrant moments within the daily maelstrom of childcare and child’s play, and in documenting the cyclical patterns of family life, Bolongaro began a process of working through his feelings of ambivalence about how we live within the idealised ‘family unit’, attempting to persuade himself that family – or at any rate, his own – can work.In the song from which ‘Gravity Begins At Home’ takes its title, the Scottish musician Ivor Cutler assures us that the theory of gravity is ‘a lot of nonsense’, and Bolongaro’s photographs appear to support this notion – that when it comes to family, everything is up in the air: here objects (eggs, daffodils, lit candles) levitate, and children fly as though possessed. Here too are celestial bodies, mirrorings and doublings, games of scale, and collage-like overlappings and abuttings, alongside quieter, homespun scenes of domestic life (hair is brushed, telly watched, laundry folded).Cutler suggests that the family is something ‘terribly important’. Even if we accept this, then the importance of family is surely far from uncomplicated. So, while there are moments when the way we live together seems to defy the rules of gravity, we should continue to question the confines and strictures of the nuclear family model.Composed of four expandable books held within a slipcase (finished with stickers applied by Bolongaro and his children) ‘Gravity Begins At Home’ gives us a dynamic, unsentimental view of family life: ambiguous, chaotic, unsettling and joyous in equal measure.128pp paperback with slipcase comprised of: 4 x 32pp concertina books170 240 mm1 x sticker sheetScreenprinted slipcase with stickers applied(each copy with a unique configuration)112 photographsISBN 978-1-9993494-8-6"

Jinmei started to make art at the age of 50. In 2015, she started to draw with color markers on sketch books. The repetitive patterns she created were endearing, stubborn, and mysterious all at once. Stunned by her mother’s talent, Yuchen decided to make a book for her, and began compiling and sequencing the drawings in 2016. In the following years, with a variety of materials including crayon and spatula, Jinmei has created much more complex forms and textures: her self-invented techniques have achieved incredible sophistication; her undulating lines and explosive dots punctuate the elemental force of life itself. In 2024, with the support from Huayu Youth Award, this book was finally published under Yuchen’s new imprint How Many Books. Titled after Jinmei’s signature on her art, “晋美 jm” has 458 pages, encompassing many phases of Jinmei’s passionate and persistent practice, as well as a preface and an interview of Jinmei by Yuchen.“晋美是我妈妈。二零一五年底晋美开始在纸上画画。先是用水彩笔画在家里速写本的空白页上，后来用蜡笔、色粉等材料画在彩色纸上。从那时起每次我回北京她都会给我看画。在这些画中，我可以感受到妈妈；但感受到更多的，是陌生难以名状的力量。那些看似重复的纹样，每次出现都有些微不同，似与不似之间的张力造成类似震颤的幻觉。重复不是机械性的而是充满情绪的，执着的，脉搏一般地稳健地冲击着我。我不仅欣赏妈妈的画，更欣赏她作为创作者的工作风格。她无时无刻不在画画：在餐桌或床边，在做饭前，洗碗后，在遛狗和去银行办事之间。妈妈的工作方式让我认识到，艺术并不只在宽敞的工作室和大把不被打扰的时间中才能产生，艺术家也未必需要成为职业，相反，艺术是人的自然而然。像花儿向着阳光，像小草钻出墙缝，妈妈在生活的琐碎与烦恼之间见缝插针地起飞，性情自然舒展，艺术自然流泻。每一次，每一张纸片，她专注而快乐地填满，让吉光片羽被灌注了永恒，平凡的日子也有了光彩 。过去的7年里，我缓慢地、勉力地搭建着这本书；与此同时，妈妈仍然高歌猛进地生产着，时常请爸爸扫描了新画用邮箱发给我，于是这书的页码越来越多。在我打这些字的同时，妈妈已经在新的画布上尝试新的笔触。这本书，只能是若干片段的集合。画的顺序不完全按照时间，我在她的能量中随波逐流，我希望打开这本书的读者也能体验类似自由的感受。”– 常羽辰，前言节选Artwork by Niu JinmeiEdited and designed by Chang YuchenScanned and photographed by Chang Qing15 x 21.5 x 3 cm, 458 p.Published by How Many BooksPresented by DREAMER FTYISBN: 979-8-9899923-8-6First Printing 2024Produced with the support of the HUAYU GROUP and the HUAYU YOUTH AWARD牛晋美 作品编辑与设计： 常羽辰扫描与摄影： 常青15 x 21.5 x 3 cm，458 页初版印刷 2024多少書 出版夢廠 出品ISBN: 979-8-9899923-8-6华宇集团及华宇青年奖提供项目支持Cover color will beassorted."

From 2021-24 Paludan visited many different sites of robotics located in Germany, Denmark, Japan, Korea, and the United States. From digital paws to laser sensors, piano-playing electro-fingers to a not-so-dexterous clamp, this book shows the human hand versioned as high-tech utensil: holders, pinchers, grabbers, supporters, strokers and cutters whose likenesses to the real thing vary according to particularity of their functions.In the robotics industry, the acronym EoAT refers to End of Arm Tools; that is, a tool required for performing a specific handlike task such as holding, cutting or lifting, and the hardest thing to design on a robot. As the subject of a portrait, the machine – rather than what it produces – is the focus and, in mirroring the hands of human workers, Paludan emphasizes their absence.Michala Paludan (b. 1983) is a Danish artist currently living and working in Copenhagen. Paludan is a fellow of the Whitney Independent Study Program (2012) and received an MFA from California Institute of the Arts (2011). She studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 2005 to 2009. During the past decade Paludan has framed how power is produced and negotiated across networks and movements, through media such as video, photography and installation. Paludan has exhibited widely in Scandinavia and abroad. Recent exhibitions include: I am Your Body: Automation at Kunsthal Aarhus, Aarhus, Open Shut Them at C.C.C.

These DIY magazines and newspapers documented art and experimental music performances spanning across the city. Today, the emergence of chronically online internet culture has resulted in newer tactics for displaying content—endless scrolls and memes. Social media’s absurdist aesthetics seep into the visual language and social makeup of NYCs underground, creating a reality rooted in cyberculture networks and schemes.Phase Zero is an experimental-exploration-time-capsule-print-publication. It is an artifact attempting to document and critique the rapidly evolving culture and visual language of the current counterculture in NYC. Its DIY aesthetic, guerilla marketing, and rapid production mimics the tactics of 70s punk fanzines to contradict the internet aesthetic and create traditional community networks. Constantly evolving to simulate culture and trend cycles, the publication’s formula is simple but never finalized. Its container is an unconventional manifesto: a conversation between the two editors with new annotations for every issue. The discourse continues in monthly community meetings where new content is collected and old content is questioned. This dialogue is manifested in its ephemera: iterations of unfinished issues, typeface sketches on ripped newsprint, existential writings scribbled haphazardly on misprints, and messy risograph flyers.Phase Zero is a space for anyone to share whatever they want.

That was the start of an animal book for Jaap. I used a dummy for the OASE journal of architecture and loosely pasted in pictures of animals that I had clipped from newspapers and magazines about art, literature and science. Plus stamps and photos from advertising brochures. Then Zeno was born and the same thing happened: an animal book for Zeno. Now I was working on two books at once. Then came Anna. Julian. Luca. At this point, there were five books-in-the-making on the table. And none of those five are finished yet. The children, as well as myself, enjoy seeing the small, ever-evolving changes.

David King (1948–2019) was a British-born artist, graphic designer, and musician best known for designing the Crass symbol. His many varied projects encompassed design, drawing, photography, sculpture, film, video, radio plays, and more. King was a core member of the New York no wave band Arsenal, and later the San Francisco post-punk bands Sleeping Dogs and Brain Rust. He generated hundreds of flyers for these bands and others during the period of 1977–1988, as well as creating logos, brand identities and posters for nightclubs like Danceteria, Pravda, and the Peppermint Lounge in New York, and the I-Beam in San Francisco.King made dozens of Xeroxed and offset zines in the late 70s and 80s that often accompanied his music projects. In the early 2000s, he began self-publishing highly idiosyncratic small-run books with subjects ranging from photographs of J.G. Ballard’s home to rock formations seen in early Western films. In the later 2000s, he released numerous books of graphic design and photography through Colpa Press, &Pens, and Gingko Press. This publication seeks to introduce readers to King’s small-press publishing projects, as well as his zines, ephemera, and illustration work.This publication accompanies the exhibition of the same name atSan Francisco Center for the Book, on view October 25–December 22, 2024.DavidKinghas exhibited at the Serpentine Gallery, the Hayward Gallery, and the Horse Hospital in London; and the Lab, Park Life, and Adobe Books in San Francisco. His films have been screened at Artists’ Television Access, San Francisco; the Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley; and Millennium and Tier 3, New York. Early performance works include contributions to EXIT at the Roundhouse in London, and EXIT with Anthony McCall in North Weald, both part of ICES, 1972. Sleeping Dogs’ music has been released by Crass Records and Brain Rust’s by Vinyl Communications.

Three decades on, he has ascended to the legendary status of the city's great living surrealist, existing, as Eliot Weinberger wrote, in a state of ""imaginal hyperdrive,"" with forty such collections to his name.Operating at the edge of language, Alexander deploys words in a way that feels prophetic—human psyches synthesize with technological artifacts; atoms and archetypes collide; bodies are vacated, voices are newly incarnated. His America—like Glissant's—is multinational and—like Coover and Spiegelman's—multivalent and symbolically unstable. That is to say, he belongs to an America circa 2024, where poetry—the art of developing new means of speaking—has never been of such artistic, technological, and political consequence.In doing so, Alexander draws from a vast array of influences, from luminaries like Aimé Césaire, Bob Kaufman, Andre Breton, Antonin Artaud, and Philip Lamantia, to holistic visions such as Sri Aurobindo's Integral Yoga, the Mayan numerical system, and Cheikh Anta Diop's perspectives on ancient Egypt. In a preview of Charismatic Spirals in the New York Times, Anne Boyer captured the essence of his work: ""visionary poetry [that] achieves its effect through sound, not image...Cadence [that] can shatter us, set the world ablaze.""Read it syllabically, surf it quickly—there is no single way to approach this work.Will Alexander (born 1948 in Los Angeles) is an African-American artist, philosopher, poet, novelist, essayist and pianist.published in November 2023English edition7 x 11 cm (softcover)204 pagesISBN :978-1-7350750-4-4"

Abandoned by their previous publisher after a pressure campaign from the Canadian government, these two works have been collected and published by fashion brand LMX Unlimited.The Secret Invasion of Canadais a dossier of never before published archival material that chart the rise and influence of the Canadian Orange Order, an Ultra-Protestant secret society that endeavored to recreate British Imperium in North America. Over the course of 8 documents, we encounter accounts of heretical sturgeon dinners, radical nationalist message boards, a theory of prophetic geology, occult suburban rituals lit by illegal whale oil candles and the secret history of the infamous assassination that triggered Canadian confederation. Far from its reputation as a mildly virtuous and conservative enclave, the country glimpsed inThe Secret Invasion of Canadais one of bizarre radicalism, endlessly buffeted by coups and counter-coups in a civic culture defined from inception by the centrality of secret societies.Empire Undoneis a formerly lost work by Sarah Jeannette-Duncan, the major novelist of fin de siéle Canadian Nationalism. Best known for The Imperialist (1904), a classic book that remains the indelible chronicle of the mysterious and forgotten tendency known as ‘Canadian Imperialism.’ Empire Undone is Duncan’s spiritual successor to that major work. Published intermittently from 1922 to 1936 across a patchwork of radical Protestant newspapers in Ontario, the text was only recently rediscovered and assembled, making this edition a genuine recovered classic. Set in Toronto in 1899, Duncan tracks the fierce loyalty of Orangeman Godfrey Cowan and Ulster immigrant Anna Alway as they defend their city and nation from the occult plots of Jesuit, Fenian, Indigenous and American conspirators.Read together, this dual volume charts a history of conspiracy from the 17th century to the present. The subterranean battle for control of British North America proves that the United States does not hold a monopoly on political radicalism or intrigue. The unique qualities of Canada has generated a nationalism that is particular in its insistence on ritual and secrecy. Absent a revolution, this peculiar national character endeavored to become more authentically British than the British themselves, generating a culture reliant on the continual affirmation and deep continuity with the mysteries of the Orange.Suppressed in Canada, this book will be of great interest to both Canadians-in-exile, as well as engaged Americans. For far too long, the story of the ascendency of the United States and its national identity has been told bereft of the omnipresent but occluded influence of its northern neighbor. This dual-volume is a much needed corrective."

He uses an electric guitar as a signal generator into mass amplification to improvise slabs of noise, saturated feedback and discordant intensities that trigger a deluge of images onto a freestanding floor-to-ceiling LED wall. The images are sourced via a stream of words that have been put into an open search across multiple online platforms. There is no theme as such, rather the immersion of sound and image is open for the audience to interpret and make sense of. The intent is to create some kind of hallucination, elation in disorientation and exhaustion from confusion. The work is an invitation for audiences to come together within a high-intensity concentration of energy. What can’t be seen, can be felt: sound as physical matter which creates a transformative experience.This expansive publication features a new essay by Branden W. Joseph, professor of art history at Columbia University and an extensive interview by curator Alexie Glass-Kantor with Marco Fusinato. It also includes texts by critical theorist and filmmaker Elizabeth Povinelli, AI researcher and author Kate Crawford, writer and curator Chus Martínez, and musicians/outre-guitarists Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth), Stephen O’Malley (SUNN O)))) and Bruce Russell (Dead C).Edited by Alexie Glass-Kantor and Michelle NewtonTexts by Kate Crawford, Branden W.

By using Google’s online translation app to obtain an English version of the original text, Ken Okiishi first of all appropriated it and peppered it with jokes, puns and references to popular culture, from Karl Lagerfeld to South Park by way of the hairstyles of certain Japanese teenagers and Volvo cars. Nick Mauss, for his part, annotated the text, and then drew on it.In tandem, the artists then published an eponymous book in which these pages were all brought together, in an edition of 500, which was quickly sold out. From 13 May to 14 August 2011, Nick Mauss presented his very first solo show in an institution at the FRAC Champagne-Ardenne. It was in the wake of this exhibition that Nick Mauss and Ken Okiishi expressed their wish to re-issueOne Season in Hell, whose outcome both offers us a new way of looking at Rimbaud’s oeuvre and extends their respective praxes in a remarkable way.Mousse Publishing co-published with FRAC Champagne-ArdenneNick Mauss and Ken Okiishi, eds.Preface by Florence Derieux64 pagesEnglish / FrenchSoftcover, 13.5 x 20 cmISBN 9788867490479"

A collection of originals related to the « image in the age of mechanical reproduction » published in the periodic Dot Dot Dot and its sequel in the digital age The Bulletins of The Serving Library. An eclectic collection gathered over the course of time almost by chance and not without some casualness, but with the requirements of a project capable of federating the research of graphic or type designers, academics, authors, international critics among the most refreshing and innovative of our time.The installation of the collection must come with a pedagogical activation, with the meeting between the periodical’s most recent editors, Stuart et Francesca Bertolotti-Bailey, Vincenzo Latronico, and the graphic design’s bachelor students of Ensba Lyon, accompanied by Alexandru Balgiu. But what we now call Covid 19’s first wave swept across Europe in September with all the consequences we know. Borders closures, confinements, curfews. In November this installation is postponed to an unknown date. From then on, everything is tried so this seminar is held via the networks. Regular videoconferences are set up by Alex Balgiu between Stuart Bertolotti-Bailey and the students from Lyon. The progress of the student’s work is regularly relayed on Ravisius Textor’s Instagram account.This book is in a way the sum, the relay and the memory of the students’ reading work of the Bulletins of the Serving Library, made in this curious pedagogical place which is experimented then: the screen, the phone, the videoconferences and the social networks.

In 460 images across 88 iconographic plates, the artist articulates her thoughts about sound through material from various registers : paintings, film extracts, technical drawings, photographic archives, etc.The reading is accompanied by an inserted booklet comprising three unpublished texts and captioned pictures annotated by the artist. Exhausting, recontextualizing and shifting its subject beyond the initial military territory, this book reminds us – like Sound Studies – that the figure of a man on the lookout and listening practices are deeply intra-connected to politics, science, medicine and art.Conception éditoriale / Editorial design : Lauren TortilConception graphique / Layout : Léa Audouze et Jérémy BarraultTextes / Texts : Raphaël Brunel, Bastien Gallet, Melissa Van Drie et Lauren TortilTraductions / Translations : Derek Byrne et Matthieu OrtaldaRelecture / Copy editing : Juliette TixierÉdition bilingue / Bilingual edition : Français, English21 x 31 cm176 pagesCouverture / Cover : Constellation Jade Onda 215 gPages intérieures / Inside pages : Munken Pure Rough 100 gReliure / Binding : Dos carré cousu Otabind / Sewn OtabindTrichromie cyan + Pantone Bright Red + noir / Three-colour cyan + Pantone bright red + black+ Livret encarté / Inserted booklet19,5 x 30 cm32 pagesPapier / Paper : Planopack blanc Weiss 50 gReliure / Binding : Piqûre à cheval / Saddle stitchingPantone Bright RedImpression / Printing : Musumeci S.p.A.

He likes to say that he is interested in too many things, from globalization, political geography, artificial intelligence, digital materialism, algorithmic governance, financial speculation, and DIY strategies, to postcolonial theories within eastern Europe and Gombrowicz-like dilemmas on what Polish identity actually is. Simon’s work captivates both visually and intellectually and is driven by constant curiosity, erudition, and the quest for what he calls “synthetic folklore”—the question of how to cherish what is particular while constructing a planetary value system with the use of new technologies.

Zhao delves into images that evoke illusions—such as imaginary friends in children’s minds, singing teapots in Disney animations, invisible shadows, and bizarre creatures that defy logic. He seeks to transform elusive illusions into visual form, for instance, capturing the world as seen through the eyes of a floating entity, where ghostly, translucent shapes drift freely.His image-based practice is rooted in these “illusionary images” while maintaining a critical awareness of the collective illusions' images may incite. Zhao’s mapping practice, on the other hand, rebels against today’s panoramic surveillance model. By merging the two, Zhao captures and crystallizes the disturbances present in contemporary digital imagery, revealing the true nature of image-driven illusions—a frenzy, either personal or collective, born from the overflow of information.这个项目延续了赵谦对图像与幻觉之间复杂关系的探索，这一主题在近几年中一直贯穿他的创作。赵谦深入探讨那些能够唤起幻觉的图像——例如儿童想象中的隐形朋友、迪士尼动画中的歌唱茶壶、无形的阴影，以及超越逻辑的奇异怪物。赵谦尝试将那些难以用图像捕捉的幻觉转化出来，比如通过漂浮物的眼睛所看到的世界，其中鬼魅般的透明形状随意飘荡。他的图像实践植根于这些“幻觉图像”，同时保持对图像可能引发的集体幻觉的警惕。赵谦的地图实践则是对当今如全景监视模型般房间的反叛。通过将二者融合，赵谦捕捉并定格了当代技术图像中出现的干扰，揭示了图像引发的幻觉的真实本质——由信息泛滥产生的个人或集体狂热。Size:170 × 225 × 5 mmBinding: PaperbackLanguage: English, ChinesePublished by P for Pinecone, November 2024Limited edition of 300 copies语言：英语，中文尺寸：170 × 225 × 5 mm印装：金属专色+四色印刷，腔背锁线胶装纸张：日本进口特级铜版纸P for Pinecone，2024年11月，限量300册"

How can we use that information to improve our lives?We tell stories about people who are harnessing lessons from the past to make a change for the better: people who are adapting ignored or forgotten ideas, fusing them with new ones, and creating environments in which people can thrive.Spanning topics such as how technology can nurture the handmade, the insights Western society can gain from Indigenous communities, and what neuroaesthetics can teach us about the impact of everyday encounters with beauty, a sense of urgency permeates our content. We hope that reading it offers valuable, varied perspectives on where we are, where we’re going, and how the past can enhance the future.The print publication, which will be released annually, continues Untapped’s focus of looking back to look forward. But unlike the journal’s bimonthly digital issues, in which weekly stories are organized around thematic questions, stories in the print edition focus on the notion that objects often contain ideas their users aren’t aware of—and that understanding what those ideas are can enhance the experience of even everyday things, allowing users to see their surroundings differently and forge deeper connections with them.

Taking visual cues from an array of cultural sources, Croizier lets his imagination run wild when taking pictures. Inspired by everything from 19th Century medical archives and freak shows, to cult classic horror like David Lynch’sEraserhead,he explores the idea of monstrosity in relation to his own queerness.In his photographs, Croizier fragments, distorts and draws upon his own body parts, constructing surreal and pseudo-scientific scenes where his head and hands, ears and feet become the centre of his studies. Set in his apartment, Croizier creates a monstrous show in order to highlight that normal and abnormal are only social constructions, and the importance of the role of the image.“The images inEverything Goes Dark A Little Further Downare weird and playfully, deliberately perverse. An array of body parts are seen in fragments throughout – torsos appear without arms, feet crush heads, bodies contort, faces melt, brains explode. In one self-portrait, the artist has manipulated the photograph to make his head appear severed but alive, his eyes still alert and staring into the lens. In another, he holds a mannequin, kissing it, and in it that act creates his own, disturbed version of a mirror image – one side flesh and blood, the other just soulless plastic. Elsewhere, Croizier draws a grid across his body in thick, black marker, echoing pictures from the medical and pseudo-scientific archives he spent time devouring for research. “The body is primordial in this work,” he says. “Our own body is the most ordinary thing to each of us, and yet the most secret. Bodies are beautiful, unique and political. In reference to anatomical iconography, I try to deconstruct normative representations of the body, with a view of asking questions such as ‘to what extent is a body a body?’ and ‘how can it free itself from the norms that constrain it?’”“To me,” he muses, “this work is a celebration of the renunciation of being normal.” It’s a project for anyone who's ever had the guts to truly, monstrously, fabulously, be themselves.Extract from a text written by Joanna L.

F Letter – New Russian Feminist Poetry,//3ssstudios.com/cdn/shop/files/l_1_1080x1530.png?v=1726093119,https://3ssstudios.com/collections/publications/products/f-letter-new-russian-feminist-poetry,"Galina Rymbu, Eugene Ostashevsky, Ainsley Morse","The first ever anthology of feminist poetry from Russia.Hailed by Gloria Steinem as “a lexicon of dissent that can be shared far and wide"", F Letter assembles the feminist poets who have palpably changed the Russian language over the last decade. Against the backdrop of state violence and oppression, this is electric dissent in pursuit of a democratic, egalitarian future. A lexicon for revolution worldwide.But this poetry's brilliance lies in its rhythm, energy, and depth of emotion—in its universal relevance rather than applied politics. As Eileen Myles writes in their foreword, ""there are lines like a curse that yodel radiantly out of the toothy mouth of the curser…lines that are just so fucking metonymic in their grace…I've been invited to witness. To smell the crowd and be charged by history.""F Letter takes its name from the Russian-language journal F pis'mo. Since 2017, this has been the center of feminist and LGBTQ+ writing, protest, and activism across Eastern Europe and Russia. It is rare that literature can wholly reinvent a language—and yet, F Letter has done so at the scale of the letter itself, coining, for instance, the ""feminitives"" that are now an everydaycontroversy in Russian society. The danger that the authors confront for such transgressive work cannot be underestimated. Many—like F pis'mo's founding editor, Galina Rymbu—are forced into exile under threat of draconian prison sentences, on charges of ""pornography"" and ""gay propaganda."""" Others have been added to the ""kill list"" of the hate group, Pila, which was likely behind the murder of Yelena Gregoriva. And yet, these writers continue to organize—most recently leading the protest against the arrest of the young illustrator Yulia Tsvetkova. ""My Vagina,"" the last poem in the anthology, was composed by Rymbu as its rallying cry. Far from a symbolic act, the poem has, in the space of weeks, been translated into twelve languages and taken up by feminist and LGBTQ+ causes worldwide.Appropriately, what concerns Rymbu are the contemporary uses of poetry as ""a form of public speech and thought, written as if there is someone else present, someone concrete."" The aim is that, out of the depths of the failed post-Soviet project, a book itself can create ""islands of freedom."" A little orange-book that exists as a grounds for feminist movements globally.As has been noted in The New Inquiry, ""publishing these poets presents its own set of difficulties"". Russian gag laws effectively censor their work at home and make it less visible abroad. For this reason, isolarii has chosen to print the anthology as a bilingual edition. To bring these poets the attention they deserve and solidify their place in that long tradition—from Baudelaire to Rushdie—of subversive, explosive verse.Edited by Galina Rymbu, Eugene Ostashevsky, Ainsley Morse.Foreword by Eileen Myles.Texts by Lida Yusupova, Daria Serenko, Lolita Agamalova, Elena Kostyleva, Egana Djabbarova, Oksana Vasyakina, Elena Georgievskaya, Stanislava Mogileva, Ekaterina Simonova, Nastya Denisova, Yulia Podlubnova, Galina Rymbu.published in November 2020bilingual edition (English / Russian)7 x 11 cm (softcover)256 pagesISBN :978-1-7350750-1-3"
Street Cop,//3ssstudios.com/cdn/shop/files/s_2_1080x1530.png?v=1726092366,https://3ssstudios.com/collections/publications/products/street-cop,"Robert Lowell Coover, Art Spiegelman","The collaboration of two American greats: master of metafiction Robert Coover and graphic legend Art Spiegelman.This illustrated tale—set in a dystopian world of infectious living dead, murderous robocops, aging street walkers, and walking streets—scrutinizes the arc of the American myth. Coover and Spiegelman bring their combined force to bear on technocracy and the police state.Street Copchallenges us to inhabit the mind of a bumbling policeman driven by a nostalgia for the gutter. Author, illustrator, and protagonist, wade through the characters, tropes, messages, and genres—from noir and horror to the police procedural—that populate the fragmented American psyche. In doing so, Street Cop insists on the possibility of emergent empathy, even as it maps the malignant structures of our time. As Coover has argued, ""in its profanity, fiction sanctifies life.""Written before the pandemic,Street Copis both provocative and prophetic—injecting new Kafka-esque complexities into the unfolding news stream and interrogating the line between a condemnable system and a sympathetic individual. If Coover ventriloquized the seat of power and corruption in The Public Burning, here he speaks through the lowest, but still complicit, bureaucratic cog: an ineffectual protagonist stripped of agency.Spiegelman, in a return to his underground comix roots, illustrates the story as his response to the events of 2020 and COVID-19. Concerned with virality in a world where time and space have lost their coordinates, Spiegelman draws on a vast cultural databank to create a collage of comics history.Street Copis the first work in Coover's long career to be illustrated and Spiegelman's first book in over a decade. The pair collaborated during the 2020 lockdown, with Coover in Rhode Island and Spiegelman in Connecticut. While each had long admired the other's work, they had never spoken before—and are still yet to meet in person.Robert Lowell Coover (born 1932 in Charles City, Iowa) is an American writer, famous for his metafiction novels.Art Spiegelman (born 1948 in Stockholm) is an American comic book artist and illustrator, a leading figure in the American underground comic strip scene of the 1970s-1980s, and the author of the famous Maus.published in October 2021English edition7 x 11 cm (softcover)ISBN : 978-1-7350750-3-7"

It details 80 ways in which one can steal a book, from the very practical, to the witty, imaginative and romantic. Originally published in 2013, this paperback reissue is making the sought after title available again at an affordable price (for those who don’t yet know the techniques described within) and is released in multiple languages. This project by David Horvitz with Edition Taube is an ongoing translation and publishing work. For each language, a publisher from the corresponding language region collaborates with David Horvitz and Edition Taube.“Hide the book inside a fake rock.”This textbook is readable, but also shamelessly draws attention to its existence as an object, a conversation starter, a thing that can be acquired by fair means or foul. This is a book that turns a point of sale display into an intellectual and ethical adventure.The work is romantic and anachronistic: as our primary source for buying books becomes impersonal online shops (that pretend to deliver a personal experience) it is almost impossible to spontaneously steal anything, and the act of disobedience becomes a story of the past. Horvitz’ compendium of delightfully written performance instructions is a collection of modern culture scripts and is, so to speak, writing history.“Cook up some garlic in olive oil in the store. Exit with the book while everyone is caught in the ecstasy of the aroma.”A comprehensive guide to stealing books with its price printed on the cover, clearly visible, provokes the visitor of a bookshop to become aware of the unconscious decisions, pre-empted by others, that we make every day. The poetic, funny and paradoxical texts also bring to light some structural elements of the mechanics of bookselling and our relation to the exchange of goods. It inserts friction into the conditioned behaviour we display when we are moving through commercial spaces. All advertising tells us to buy things, we rarely come across a message encouraging us to steal—especially not one with the authority that print still carries.“Fill a bag with the books you want. Make it heavier than you can carry. Ask an employee to help you carry it outside.”Maybe this publication provides some real options: Buy the book for only€9.99 and then save a lot of money on books in the future with all the skills you can learn with this guide? Steal the book because it is declaring that it’s okay to steal books (although it doesn’t)? Or use it as a device to create a conversation about the power of analogue media, and perhaps decide to support the artists, authors, designers, publishers, printers, distributors and bookshops, and just buy more books?“Smash a hole in the store’s window. Throw the book through the hole.”Softcover, 10.5 × 15.5 cm. Page number varies (84 or 86)."

This list is astonishing because it shows how, within Europe, everyone is spying on everyone else. But it also shows clichés and images that are used at the highest level between states. Why is the code name for Turkey a hemp plant, but the code name for the USA is a flowering hydrangea? Because of its floridity, this list was internally called the ""Fleurop list"" in intelligence circles – after the well-known florist from the Internet. The name thus brings a pop and commercial world touch to the world of state secrets. In the photo series, the various countries are presented with artificial plants and are portrayed drippingly beautiful in the photo studio: Fake flowers, like fake names as an image for a (secret) artificial second world that is above what is publicly known. This world mixes in the events of the world every day and leaves its footprints. The sashes in the national flags are reminiscent of the wreaths and flowers and flower arrangements in memory of important events.ISBN 978-3-945900-56-7Artist: Sebastian UtzniDesign: Jan Steinbach, Edition Taube"

Kua Fu Chasing the Sun 夸父逐日,//3ssstudios.com/cdn/shop/files/1_09f058ed-36da-4ff3-823f-4b0fd1c846b4_1080x1530.png?v=1719776489,https://3ssstudios.com/collections/publications/products/kua-fu-chasing-the-sun,Xiao Longhua / 小龙花,"""Kua Fu Chasing the Sun"" is an ancient mythological story. In modern society, preserving memories through oral storytelling has virtually disappeared. This is Xiao Longhua’s attempt to reshape this story passed down through generations, blending his own understanding and uncovering crevices of narrative from fragmental information concealed in various sources. He presents a new form of memory medium - digital stele, awaiting decipherment and interpretation by future generations.On the box there is a diagram, which is composed according to a text written by Xiao Yong. In the diagram, the basic narrative of Kua Fu chasing the Sun is disassembled into these 5 structural points, ensuring the most basic completeness and coherence of the story. Each point can be expanded into a set composed of endless lexical elements. Please mix and match them arbitrarily, creating plots that may be bizarre, chaotic, funny, or absurd, but are just one of the countless possibilities.继《盲人摸象》之后，小龙花再次就传统故事主题进行自命题创作。《山海经》中的寥寥数语，令人浮想联翩，我们现在所熟悉的故事情节与这个最初版本类似，但神话的传递本来就会产生很多不同的拷贝，人们对“逐日”这一行为的评价褒贬不一，引申义也大相径庭。在流传的过程中，远古的信息的显现和掩盖同样具有巨大能量，小龙花试图邀请大家像考古一样，去往时空的缝隙中，挖掘并重现被掩盖的、甚至遗失的部分。一开始，小龙花用绘图软件像搭积木一样搭建出夸父的形象，这个模型每换一个角度，就成为意外之喜，它的成像效果类似平面里的三维，和专业三维软件的准确建模完全不同，而这种不准确刚好是艺术家想要的。在最终的画面中，夸父的形体从无到有，过程里的每个阶段，身体在不同光线下呈现不同的质感，最终像岩石般坚硬。他向太阳展开双臂时，身后却投下一棵树影。小龙花决定把创作中的不确定性全都表达于画面之中，在森罗万象的夸父宇宙藏匿了许多神秘信息，有待观看者自行发现与想象。许多原始部落膜拜太阳神，对火的恐惧和向往是并存的，在干旱地区，则更显现对水源的依赖，因此也有“夸父”是族名的说法，即夸父族人把因生存环境恶化而寻找水源的迁徙过程以神话形式记录了下来。故事结尾，筋疲力尽的巨人轰然倒地，心中渴望的究竟是没有追到的太阳还是被饮尽的河水？我们不得而知。在现代社会，通过口述存储记忆的方式几乎失传，小龙花尝试从不同来源的信息碎片的缝隙之间找到自己的语言。夸父最终化作了山石，作为一种纪事载体，石碑的留存似乎具有某种永恒性——小龙花想要接近这种永恒性。尽管在多变的数字世界创造永恒绝非易事，小龙花还是用建立“数字石碑”的方式完成了这个故事。设计师白魁是“夸父逐日”创作全程的观看者，也是纸面作品的参与者。在这个系列中，大多数画面都被设置成单色图像，利用特殊调制的黑色油墨，印刷出厚实的质地和细腻的层次感。而珍贵的彩色画面，则留给了狂奔中的夸父——小龙花以热感应图像为色彩灵感的创作，是整个故事最绚丽壮美的部分，也是艺术家对心目中的夸父形象的最完整表述。“夸父逐日”的文字和图像创作从时间和空间上都是分开进行的。我们的朋友萧勇在看过最初的印样之后，大受感动，欣然接受约稿。基于多年对图像学研究的狂热兴趣和经营图像学书籍的书商经验，萧勇为“夸父逐日”写了一篇文章，文中将夸父、手杖、追、太阳、消失的河流这五个故事基本元素一一列出，然后在每个元素集合中填入具体形象，抽象暧昧的上古神话成为了诡异、错乱、滑稽、荒谬，却有血有肉的具象化身。这段文字最终以表格形式呈现：在五个集合中各放入五个词组，竟能得到多达3125 种不同的叙事组合！表格和词汇索引被印刷在用来承装图像作品的纸盒表面，由于纸盒一体成型的特殊结构，将折叠处翻转打开，就可以在同一平面上阅读到所有信息。读者可以将这些元素任意拼合，甚至继续假设下去，得到更多可能性。文化审查部门目前定义“书”，就是装订成册的模样。出版物分为装订版和未装订版，意在规避目前国内对独立出版物的禁止态度，把装订的程序让给读者。305 × 305mm三维渲染 李栋临｜文字 萧勇｜设计 白魁3D Rendering: Li DonglinText: Xiao YongDesign: Bai Kui"

These DIY magazines and newspapers documented art and experimental music performances spanning across the city. Today, the emergence of chronically online internet culture has resulted in newer tactics for displaying content—endless scrolls and memes. Social media’s absurdist aesthetics seep into the visual language and social makeup of NYCs underground, creating a reality rooted in cyberculture networks and schemes.Phase Zero is an experimental-exploration-time-capsule-print-publication. It is an artifact attempting to document and critique the rapidly evolving culture and visual language of the current counterculture in NYC. Its DIY aesthetic, guerilla marketing, and rapid production mimics the tactics of 70s punk fanzines to contradict the internet aesthetic and create traditional community networks. Constantly evolving to simulate culture and trend cycles, the publication’s formula is simple but never finalized. Its container is an unconventional manifesto: a conversation between the two editors with new annotations for every issue. The discourse continues in monthly community meetings where new content is collected and old content is questioned. This dialogue is manifested in its ephemera: iterations of unfinished issues, typeface sketches on ripped newsprint, existential writings scribbled haphazardly on misprints, and messy risograph flyers.Phase Zero is a space for anyone to share whatever they want.

Almost nothing here is what it appears to be at first glance - the sculptures photographed in the streets as well as in hotel rooms were never in the indicated places, the images are partly automatically deconstructed or created by software; the majority of the works were created in several steps that took place outside and inside the studio.Every picture questions and discusses its conditions of production, the authenticity of what is shown, and the unconscious expectations and experiences that one brings to the table when looking at an image.“Body Double is a book long portrait of Los Angeles made with appropriated images, constructed images, sculpted images and manifested experiences in conversation with elements, fragments of possible memories coexisting with real deconstructions, and real uncertainties glueing it all together.

How could an art residency within Robida look like? What are the values we imagine it to have? Who is an inhabitants, temporary, cyclical, permanent? How to share responsibilities and take care of a place? How to be a host and a guest?The publicationCare of Margins, titled after the symposium organised by Robida, contains some of the reflections shared during few days in September 2021.→symposium Care of MarginsSome of the contributions question the concept of residency in itself, others are very personal memories of those days highlighting the valuable moments, routines and thoughts we shared. Other texts try to transgress dichotomies such as local vs. foreign, insider vs. outsider, host vs. guest, bringing up themes such as translocal connectedness as in the reflections of Curdin Tones. The affective relation between space and temporary or permanent inhabitants is explored in the poetic text of Mara Usai while a more scientific, micro-biological relation to landscape is addressed by Philipp Kolmann. Jack Bardwell reflects on the possibility of a polyrhythmic co-existence of the guests and hosts while Lenn Cox underlines the importance of generative boundaries, referring to personal and collective everyday ecologies. Francesca Lucchitta widely reflects on daily routines, recalling moments and the atmosphere of those days and Janja shares notes on the power of togetherness. Studio Wild focuses on the building up of the residency, imagined as a collective action where taking part in the residency could also mean contributing to the renovation of the building itself, while Tommaso Garavini proposes the beautiful metaphor of the house as a toolbox or as a Swiss pocket knife. Laura Savina speaks of a fertile white, to refer to the countless and wide possibilities opening in front of us when imagining this space, intended as a new, empty, white paper. Besides describing her experience as the first artist in residency to inhabit the village for a longer period of time, Kim Lang focuses on the concept of the calendar as one of the conclusions we reached during the symposium. The calendar is a tool that addresses all the previously mentioned topics: the relation of the artists/researchers/architects/etc. to landscape, their inclusion in the rhythms of the community and the need of sharing with them responsibilities, of making them become dwellers of the village.Contributions by: Jack Bardwell, Lenn Cox, Tommaso Garavini, Tymon Hogenelst, Philipp Kolmann, Kim Lang, Francesca Lucchitta, Jesse van der Ploeg, Johannes Reisigl, Vida Rucli, Laura Savina, Janja Šušnjar, Curdin Tones, Mara Usai.Editors: Kim Lang, Vida RucliGraphic designers: Francesca Lucchitta, Kim LangPrinted by: Riso Paradiso (Ljubljana)Published by: Robida2024"

But this was also the starting point for a visual examination of the role and meaning of the enemy image in her fragmented childhood in former Yugoslavia and how this history echoes upon this day.The complex history and contested borders that shaped the countries of former Yugoslavia provide the stage on which Mesić weaves new, personal narratives. In light of recent political developments in Europe, the book encourages us to reflect on our own experiences. By bringing these to light, it helps to counter the nationalist narratives that dominate today’s political landscape. But is there a way to reconcile the negative and positive effects of nationalism?When you point a finger, three are pointing backis composed of photographs, newspaper clippings, television clips, rumours, whispered conversations, written stories, and meticulously crafted relics made from matches and matchboxes.Lana Mesićwas born in 1987 in Zagreb, Croatia and emigrated to the Netherlands in 2003.

Why are we no longer striving to create one? He began drawing at his kitchen table in search of answers to the question of the long-lost quest for utopia.Early Retirementbegs the crucial question: how do we find the strength to come together against relentless adversity in the United States of America?Early Retirement, narrated by a shadowy figure from American history, revolves around Mr. Wolfson, a werewolf and Doomsday prophet in New York City’s street prophecy scene, and The Drummer, one of the three heralds of the Apocalypse. One day, The Drummer learns that the Truth has been delivered to Mr. Wolfson. Things quickly spiral out of control, leading to a three-way standoff between the Will of the People, the Will of Government and the Will of God.Gibson’s personal lens on American culture stems from his viewpoint as an artist, a black male, a professor at Yale, an American history buff and comic book nerd. All this fuels his exploration of American culture through the high and low visual languages of painting and comics to reveal a narrative that spells out our fabricated destruction. Gibson uses black ink to create stark contrasts and settings in which positive and negative space define the composition. He relies on a minimal aesthetic, playing off of both fine art and the comic book vernacular of sequential narrative. He rarely edits his drawings, trusting what goes down on the page to take form organically and tell a legible story, trusting his drawings to provide answers, to tell us the future, the truth.“I want to have a conversation about our shared understanding that things need to change, and that everything is very much at stake.

In bringing these artists together to speak and lay compiled in this book, we ask ourselves: what kind of spaces are necessary to incubate productive conversations in an art world prone to creating destabilizing conditions?Spanning our art nonprofit's decade of existence, a lot of our work has been documented in fragmented ways over the internet, on social media accounts, and in the memories of those there in person.

He examines numerous images, analysing the manual work that went into editing them, a primitive process from today’s perspective. This throws up questions about the material nature of the decades-old image supports and the physicality of the people depicted. The motifs are cropped, styled, and “beautified”, a practice that seems grotesque, radical, and even violent when it becomes evident how this also constructs an illusory image in the public memory. The meticulous black-and-white appropriations are an act of media archaeology, directing our attention to the images’ promise of authenticity and to the striking painterly quality of the retouched colour. The works, produced in the period since 2013, blur the boundary between photography and painting, between the documentary and its opposite.Sebastian Riemer (b. 1982 in Oberhausen) lives and works in Düsseldorf.

It encompasses all forms of socially necessary – or reproductive – labor: raising children, cooking, cleaning, shopping, looking after the elderly and the ill, and many other tasks. It is what allows for and sustains productive labor (including architectural labor) in the first place. Although economic production depends on the work of social reproduction, care work is usually unpaid and pushed out of sight. It is indisputable that care work falls disproportionately upon women and unevenly along lines of race and class. Demographic changes, environmental crises, growing mobility, transformations of labor, and the reconfiguration of traditional institutions of care – from the nuclear family to welfare state provisions – have made the inequity of care a key problem in architectural debates.Edited byGabrielle Schaad,Torsten LangeContributions byMax J.

And what is the effect of (almost) winning on someone’s life or that of people around them? InJust My Luck, Cécile Hupin and Katherine Longly (BE) set out to compare dream to reality by giving a voice to those who won or came close to winning a jackpot, for better or for worse. Their stories paint a picture of our society, our aspirations, our beliefs, and our relationship with money.Human beings have always dreamt of the small miracle that could change their lives, and the invention of lottery games turned pure fantasy into a realm of possibility. Intrigued by the consequences that such upheaval can have on someone’s life, Hupin and Longly spent five years interviewing those who have experienced it. Far from the glitz, all accounts seemed inextricably linked to the notions of luck and bad luck. As if to believe in one was to risk activating the other.We meet Serkan, the newsagent who had to close his shop after a street sweeper won 168 million. We meet Paul, who saw his winnings slip through his fingers because of a technical problem at the draw. We meet Ahmed, who was unfairly accused of forging his winning ticket and served a year in prison. We meet Juliette who, despite winning a million, continued to work behind the bar. And we meet many others.Halfway between artistic and sociological research,Just My Luckcontains only first-hand accounts, in order to emphasise the personal stories behind the catchy headlines that the tabloid press is so fond of.Katherine and Cécile share a strong taste for investigative work and human encounters. Together, they create hybrid projects that capture, with tenderness and humour, extra-ordinary realities that are fiercely revealing of the world we live in.Cécile Hupinis a writer, performer and designer, with degrees in theatre from IAD and set design from La Cambre.

Weikendorf I & II,//3ssstudios.com/cdn/shop/files/w_1_1080x1530.png?v=1708924717,https://3ssstudios.com/collections/publications/products/weikendorf-i-ii,Petra Feriancová,"These books are based on two different projects led by the artist during a site-specific exhibition at a gallery in Weikendorf, a little town in Lower Austria. For the first, she invited the local community to bring her photographs that would describe their lives in Weikendorf and exhibited it. The second project includes a black and white photographic installation playing on the reflections of an old fire station.“The inhabitants of Weikendorf are the main audience [of the Kunstraum Weikendorf], they pass by every day. At once I get an idea to work with people, almost all of whom designed, built and took care of their homes. They all chose the space they live in, they keep it up and improve it. The presence of the gallery space must have some significance for them and perhaps if their own works were on display, they would view the white cube with pride and joy. Since I did not know much about Weikendorf before, I thought about asking people to help me get to know by sharing and experiences and knowledge about their town. I would ask them to choose and photograph something they created, something they are proud of, for instance they house, harvest, home-cooked meals or baked goods, even their families and let me exhibit their photographs. The photographs would be split into genres (still life, portrait, landscape, etc.) or even better into categories (the people, their work, their hobby, their flowers and trees, their houses, their animals, etc.)”Petra Feriancová onWeikendorf I.“I am gazing into an empty white space through a large glass window, in which I can make out a reflection of a housing development. The old fire station, in front of which I'm standing, is strategically located by the main road in the center of a town in Lower Austria, Weikendorf.Despite the photogenic quality of the reflection in the window, I decided to shoot the view from inside the gallery, from the spot where the photograph will later be placed. Since the gallery is mostly closed, the view from within it is very unique, which makes it even more exclusive and I get to satisfy my curiosity. The photograph will simply be taken from the where where it will later be exhibited. The architectural disposition, the place from where the photograph will be taken and the window, acting as the frame, all determine the range of the view depicted in the shot. The photograph indicates the place of its origin—the interior of the gallery—and in a way it will make it accessible to the spectator.The depiction of a rather dull scene becomes an artwork due to its white cube setting but also because of the medium, an analogue black & white photograph. In photography the black & white aspect is aesthetically more pleasing and in a simplified cinematic culture it is a representation of the past. Thus this image, essentially devoid of any esthetics, evokes a sense of an almost classical genre because of the siting and the choice of medium.In this case I want to take advantage of the architectural and urban aspect of the gallery together with the fact that the space is sealed off, leaving the viewer to stand outside, looking inwards. I find the reflection in the large glass window, through which one can gaze inside yet also observe the situation outside—the exterior of the gallery, to be a fitting theme of the exhibition in this space. It is not simply like pointing mirror, but rather conveying a quotidian ordinary situation, fixed in a moment, perhaps similar to many other moments yet impossible to repeat exactly. I decided to shoot the view from inside the gallery, from the spot where the photograph will be later placed. the architectural disposition, the place where the photograph will be taken at the window, acting as the frame, all determine the range of the view depicted in the shot. It is not up to me to decide, it has been chosen for me.”Petra Feriancová onWeikendorf II.published in 2012bilingual edition (English / German)30 x 21 cm (softcover)58 pages + 12 pages (color & b/w ill.)Petra Feriancová (born in 1977 in Bratislava, where she lives and works) is a Slovak contemporary artist, writer and curator. She works with the intention of post-production. The key moment of her work is the conceptualisation of her own emotional reactions to the processes of perception and memory, as well as an examination of the conditions under which they are shared. She works mostly with already made images, texts and archives, which she then interprets and methodically interchanges. The main aim of manipulating a reference—pictorial or discursive—is to provide the spectator with the original affective reaction to it."

Tracing a migration that occurred between the 8th and 14th centuries, the artist explores an interest, namely the Romani culture. Vitone’s research has concentrated on the concept of nomadism and the identity of ethnic minorities through an analysis of his cultural productions – from art to cartography, architecture, music and food – as elements that encourage awareness among people and different cultures. The account of the Roma migration route becomes a tool for a broader reflection on the idea of place and travel, community, tradition, and the perpetuation of social clichés and stigma. The journey back to the origins of the Roma people is represented through an external gaze that goes beyond the stereotypes with which the Roma are commonly associated, focusing instead on representing the intellectual bourgeoisie through encounters with political personalities, social activists, academics. For Vitone, the Roma population represents a modern and transnational ideal of a population, almost becoming a forerunner, even in light of the current mass migrations.The project is promoted by Centro per l’arte contemporanea Luigi Pecci, Prato.CONTRIBUTORS: Daniele Caspar  /  Cristiana PerrellaDesign: Teresa Piardi - Maxwell Studio"

The film questions what happens when the world leans towards populism and conservatism. The sound architecture piece constructs alternative realities of ecological collapse after the construction of Trump’s border wall proposal. Layers of sound are combined with shadowy shots of arid landscapes. Facts and statistics from scientists, journalists and the former President’s speeches are referenced. The piece reaches a crescendo as a biologist tracks a genetically mutated species along the US Mexico border. The artist received The 2020 Aesthetica Art Prize’s Emerging Prize for “Counterfictions”. This publication is designed by RELATED DEPARTMENT as an archive folder of loose leaves containing research materials, video stills, diagrams, model prototypes and other related files for this artwork.在《边境怪谈》中，Chris尝试用视频、小说、声音、建筑和表演来质疑政治政策和社会联系。《边境怪谈》以美国前总统特朗普为起点，他在公众的想象中建立了一堵虚构的墙。作品质疑当世界向民粹主义和保守主义倾斜时会发生什么。这个声音建筑作品构建了特朗普建造边境墙提案后生态崩溃的另一种现实。层层叠叠的声音与干旱地貌的朦胧镜头相结合。来自科学家、记者和前总统演讲的事实和统计数据被引用。当一位生物学家沿着美国墨西哥边境追踪一个基因突变的物种时，作品的叙事达到了高潮。Chris凭借《边境怪谈》获得了2020年英国Aesthetica艺术奖。Page Bureau(书局) is the self-publishing practice of the independent graphic design studio, RELATED DEPARTMENT (有关设计部门) from Shanghai.

It was produced at a time of radical discourse about the role of art in society. Drawing on the influence of conceptual art, which was still in its infancy at the time, Rautert focused on the conditions surrounding his own creative process, the question of authorship, original and copy, and the role of the viewer. His cycle of works deals with issues that, in view of the technical means photography had at its disposal and its notional claim to depict the world realistically and truthfully, assumed particular importance and urgency—as they still do today, especially given the digital image worlds that we now occupy.The book is published in conjunction with the exhibition Bildanalytische Photographie, 1968 –1974 at the Kupferstich-Kabinett Dresden (1 July to 25 September 2016), where the entire cycle will be presented for the first time.56 pp.with 37 black-white and 10 colour illustrationsthread-sewn softcoverLeipzig July, 2016ISBN: 9783959051088Edition Number: 1Width: 16 cmLength: 21 cmLanguage(s): English, GermanEditor: Kunstfonds/Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, Stephanie BuckDesigner: Joachim Bartsch, Timo Grimberg, Toni Schönbuchner, a r cText: Stephanie Buck, Linda Conze, Rebecca WiltonArtist: Timm RautertPhotographer: Timm Rautert"

In the story, an organization called ‘WIFI-POET’ broadcasts poems through the lines of wireless network names by tampering with public routers. After writing the story, I have been haunted by the idea of setting up the organization for real. With the help of my good friend Edward, we debuted the first iteration of WIFI-POET at Basement 6, Shanghai in 2017.Basement 6 is a former air-raid shelter in Shanghai in which cell reception is impossible. Through our proprietary router and editing interface, participants of the workshop assigned themselves pen-names and contributed to an ever-evolving poem comprised of Wi-Fi networks, by consistently naming and renaming them. Everyone is entitled to create, edit, and delete the lines.In early 2019, I invited Shanghai-based design studio Related Department to materialize the outcome of the workshop into a physical volume. The WIFI-POET book encapsulates over 2000 lines of verse through the 4 hours of collective creation, accompanied with photographs and luminescent ink overlay for the first chapter.I am curious how this peculiar anthology would be perceived. It can be seen as the documentation of a single evolving poem, or the compilation of a thousand unique poems. Of course, to some, it is probably a tome of nonsense.WIFI-POET will continue to evolve.

In a world with no natural resources left, transformation and recycling are the only way forward.Our Rags Magazineis a collaborative project by Aimée Zito Lema and Elisa van Joolen that investigates transformative processes, proposing new forms of collective production aimed at the reuse of discarded clothing and textiles. The project and resulting magazine question consumer behaviour and its relationship to the world in which we live. Further expanding the potential of recycled material,Our Rags Magazineis a magazine where the pages not only show clothing, but actually are clothing.The project started in 2019 with a workshop in which children were invited to imagine new ways of creating garments and new ways of dressing. The workshop revolved around dissecting discarded pieces of clothing brought in by the participating children. Subsequently, all garments were cut into small pieces and recycled into a new material: paper. A Dutch windmill in Loenen (NL) which still masters the age-old technique of transforming old rags in cotton-based paper transformed the shredded garments into coarse and tactile paper sheets that form the material base ofOur Rags Magazine. Returned to the workshop participants, the kids collectively made highly imaginative garments from the rags-to-paper material at the Rijksakademie voor Beeldende Kunsten.Our Rags Magazinepushes the possibilities of recycled material even further. By manufacturing a fashion publication that is printed on this very material – creating a magazine of which the pages don’t merely show the garments, but are the garments – this project shows the creative potential recycling garments and textile can offer.Developed in close collaboration with graphic designer Elisabeth Klement.

Drawing inspiration from the “Classic of Mountains and Seas,"" it derives divine and mystical characters and narratives through a creative process rooted in the functionalities and evolutionary changes of modern communication devices. The phenomenon of deification and worship of these devices stems from the inner unease of individuals and their cravings. As civilization advances, people's desire for communication and technology has become as significant as their desire for life itself. Modern individuals devote their time and energy to their communication devices, endowing them with god-like powers, nurturing their dominion over the human psyche, and fulfilling human desires.Apotheosisis divided into seven sections, each representing different communication deities, accompanied by their respective illustration images and ancient anecdotes.Illustration: Wenjing YangDesign: AoAo Ying"

The production and trade of cane sugar have been vital local industries since ancient times. Moreover, plums and citrus fruits are extensively cultivated in this area. The abundant availability of these raw materials has given rise to a variety of classic snacks like preserved plums and other candied fruits.

Later, its copyright was controversially claimed by Franklin Loufrani. Today, this yellow smiley face, as a contemporary symbol, possesses an absurdity as contradictory as its ownership: cheap, expensive, rebellious, joyful... It can be a tag for underground rebellious culture, yet it also appears on free plastic bags popular from Chinatown to the world over, becoming a metaphor for pandering to stereotypes. Ironically, amidst the pandemic, this positive smiley symbol once again gained market popularity. Due to the intricate phenomena surrounding the yellow smiley, its meaning has become blurred. In today's world, where identity politics has, in some sense, become a universal value, it's intriguing to speculate on the ripples caused if this yellow smiley was recolored to darker shades or other colors. If such speculation touches or even breaches the line of ""political correctness,"" it further attests to the systemic issues underlying the past dissemination of the yellow smiley. What does yellow represent? What does a smile signify? From this viewpoint, the yellow grin isn't universal at all; it seems rather cheap.

Mementos of both human and scientific adventures, they are the tangible traces of the historical capabilities of these research centers which designed and produced instruments to observe the universe.These black and white images have gradually lost their function andpurpose. They may have been abandoned, but they have still escaped the dreadful outcome of so many unusable documents, they were gifted to the artist Caroline Corbasson who, alongside the photographer Andrea Montano, explored the poetry within.The book and its images will be accompanied by a text by the french historian and curator Luce Lebart:“With or without legends, these images of stellar fields torn from their context of production and use resemble as much a photogram of dust clusters as a magnification of the photolytic structure of the silver grains constituting the image. The fascinating beauty of these photographs oscillates in vertigo between the immensely large and the immensely small, between the star and the task, between the dust and the star. And the boundaries are porous between a scientific image and an abstract image offered to aesthetic delight.These osmosis between scientific and artistic images recall the malleability of photographs. They have this immense facility to one day be in the field of science, another in the field of archive and then art to be considered again as documents and finally all at once.”32 × 24 cm,47p, hardcoverFrench / EnglishIMAGES: CAROLINE CORBASSONAND ANDREA MONTANOTEXT: LUCE LEBARTEDITORIAL DIRECTION & SEQUENCING:BUREAU KAYSERDESIGN: SYNDICATTRANSLATION: JEFFREY ZUCHERMANCAPTIONS: MICHEL MARCELIN(CNRS RESEARCH DIRECTOR)PROJECT SUPPORTED BYFONDATION ANTOINE DE GALBERT500 CopiesJanuary 2023"

Her abstract pictures are rich in colour and pattern and often combined with multiple perspectives, alluding to the worlds hidden in books, evoking landscapes, cityscapes, or interiors.

He basically took the art he found in galleries and turned the paintings and sculptures into ""Readymades"". He didn't go to the hardware store to look for ""found objects"". He went to Leo Castelli's and found art. He would sell the art by putting red dots near the work or he would hit the art with a tuning fork to get the sound off art and much more. The end result of all this was the birth of a new way of seeing and a brand new way of painting.Originally published in 1973, this re-issue includes a pamphlet with commentary from Neke Carson and an Afterword by Katherine Jánszky Michaelsen.136 p, ills colour & bw, paperback, 27 x 19 cm"

Her colorful, imaginative costumes and props are all handmade, and her friends, her relatives and herself make up the cast. Her performance pieces include elements of folk theatre and street spectacle as well as plenty of scientific, literary and pop cultural allusions. Humorous, informal, improvised and unconventional elements are also writ large in Monster Chetwynd’s work.This kind of creative work generally defies any attempts to archive or eternize it. “My performances are exciting live moments that are difficult to document,” concedes Chetwynd. And yet this book seeks to do just that. “In looking at a printed survey such as this, however, the reader’s energy builds in a way that is similar to witnessing one of the live events.” And this is indeed a book about building energy, solidarity and interconnectedness.Full to bursting with photographic documentation and source material, this book graphically retraces Monster Chetwynd’s creative years from 2007 to 2018. The photo series are framed by richly illustrated fanzines, mostly in English, covering each production, including references to sources of inspiration and cast lists.Monster Chetwynd(b. 1973, London) is a British performance artist. She studied anthropology and later fine arts at the University College London and the Royal College of Art in London.

He has since been to various urban peripheries where he encountered ruins, wild animals and vegetation, shamans, and many other things beyond mundane life. As an artist, TONG realized that he had enthusiastically appropriated large amounts of studio time for fishing. It brought him from artmaking to explorations of the city’s less-seen aspects.TONG keeps visual and textual notes of all his fishing trips: his harvest, his cooking of fish dishes, his tackle, companions, the weather, the route, the landscapes, all of which he archives inside his laptop. This archive became the starting point for this publication.With more than 200 images, 3 flip books of video stills, and other related objects, the Journal offers a glimpse into TONG’s fishing trips around the city. Photos are printed in various sizes, bundled loosely using fish lines, tagged and arranged according to TONG's organizing habits. Boxed up in a transparent case, the publication materializes TONG’s digital archive, while it also suggests the form of a memory box, a treasure case, and a fish tank.NYC Fishing Journalpresents images and notes from 62 out of hundreds of TONG’s fishing trips between 2015 and 2018. It is an editioned publication, an archive of a project, an artist book, a piece of artwork, a collaboration, and all of the above at once.-Yi Xin TONG is a New York-based artist. Tong studied geology at China University of Geosciences in Beijing and received his BFA in Visual Art from Simon Fraser University and MFA in Studio Art from New York University. In poetic and absurd languages, he uses multimedia installation, site-specific project, video, and sound to analyze seemingly desperate social conditions, and our contradictory relationships with ourselves and with other living beings, objects, and cultural entities. Recent solo exhibitions include NARS Foundation, Vanguard Gallery, Katzman Contemporary; group exhibitions include the BRIC Biennial, Guangzhou Airport Biennale, Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art, National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts, MOCA Shanghai, CAFA Art Museum, Long March Space, Alyssa Davis Gallery, Chambers Fine Art, and Hanart TZ Gallery.July 2019Overall dimensions variableContainer size: 5.75 in × 13.5 in × 7 in (14.6 cm × 34.3 cm ×17.8 cm)Edition: 15 + 5 A.P.With Certificate and signature by the artist"

By the number of years or months or days or minutes lived? By the number of photographs taken, government documents issued, letters written? By the number of hamburgers eaten, or the number of hummingbirds fed? By the number of people loved? And what can one life measured show us? About a historical moment, a geographic place, about choices made? What can the measurements of one life tell us about what mattered and what did not, about how to find joy, relieve pain, keep challenging? What can we learn from hummingbirds or hamburgers or love?Between January 1, 1925 and May 13, 2015, Shoichi Yoshida was alive: He woke up every day at 4am, was born in Hawaii, moved to Los Angeles, fought for America in the War Crimes Detachment in the Philippines and Japan in World War II (he ticked the ‘Japanese’ box on his registration card), married and had kids (and then his kids had kids), lifted weights, gardened, danced, played the piano, played with his kids, played with his grandkids, worked as a reflexologist, collected things (small things mainly, and things that mark time), went on holidays, listened to music, embraced change, smart phones and the internet, wrote love letters, sent valentines, hid easter eggs, decorated Christmas trees, took pictures (of his family and hummingbirds and the wide expanse of the sea), laughed, ate In n’ Out with his grandson (double double, protein style, animal style with a strawberry shake and chips), experienced joy and pain (and chose joy and relieved pain), loved his family, hummingbirds, wide expanses of the sea, also silly hats, sunsets, tradition and routine, celebrated 90 birthdays, hated the color red, was notsentimental, and went to sleep every evening at 7pm, though not necessarily in that order.In this order: At twenty to seven, a smiling, athletic teenager joins the US military, his blue steel eyes even more dashing in uniform, for about an hour. Well, to start out with, let me thank you sincerely for your very sweet, lovely, and for your very touching report and no kidding, I just love it. And by a quarter past eight, he is married, with his bride, on bicycles, on Catalina Island. By 9, there are kids and backyard inflatable pools, streamers and birthday cakes, tether ball and freshly caught fish. We build strong kids, strong families, strong communities. Time moves differently, becomes harder to tell, obscured as it is by the accumulation of growing and living. And at a quarter past 11, (nearly halfway!), he is dancing, drifting lightly into the afternoon. Between 1 and 2, a little gambling, more dancing, a funeral—then skiing, a kiss, a dinner party. May all your events end up with a positive note. By mid-afternoon, he is markedly older, wrapped in laugh lines and grandchildren learning how to lift weights and play soccer, take pictures and find joy. At 4, a pause for elegance: a double take, a second chance. Is it then or now? Who can remember which dress was which? Only that you looked beautiful. Let’s Do It Some Other Time, OK? Afterwards, he is older still, but his energy is new, his eyes youthful, hungry, learning. He massages feet now and celebrates. Time passes again, stuffed with work and ping pong and basketball. And then the evening is upon him, the last trip home, the last year, the last hour. A lei, a birthday cake, a hummingbird. Don’t be sad, he says in a bejeweled cowboy hat, with an ice cream sandwich, a wink. Ok Now.

In such places, the functioning of our environment, of nature and of our body is measured and analysed for further understanding. In this project, I  focus on do-it-yourself gestures and on the modeling of reality performed by researchers. Therefore, I have depicted contemporary research (public, private and civic) and what forebodes our future. Through a non-linear narration allowing me to transition from trivial to complex or even absurd subjects, this body of work tells the story of life. In a world where seasons no longer exist and where many people are no longer interested in what is inside objects, our environment seems very disconnected from the world of knowledge and from how it came into being. This work thus comes from the desire to better understand how our environment is studied and created."" Marie Quéau""We can fix us.

Each issue can be unfolded into another type of wearable item and carries stories about the role of garments in lives, cultures and practices from various artists, designers, writers, thinkers.The fabric-like paper carries stories that stem from the situatedness of garments in non-commercial, cultural, and daily realities.Booklookplays with familiar and important agents in the fashion industry: the garment, the fashion magazine, and as the title suggests, the lookbook, a publication in which brands traditionally offer buyers an overview of their collection (their ‘looks’).Booklookinstead aims to address this dominant consumerist fashion discourse. Instead of denying and cutting the cords with the reality of production, cultural situatedness, historical references and practices of use,Booklookopens up these narratives and tells exactly these stories.The first issue –Booklook Apron-Delantal– shares a text (in both English and Spanish) by artist and researcherMaría Naidichabout the Tseltalero dress, a garment created and worn by women from both Tseltal and Tojolabal communities in the Lacandon jungle, in southeastern Mexico. The Tseltalero dress represents an expression of women’s resistance to centuries of control over their clothing since the colonial times. It is a garment that is produced collectively and strengthens relationships between women, allowing them to organize and function autonomously. The Tseltalero dress represents the relationships between the community, its environment and other human and non-human beings. Based on the Tojolabal understanding that endows all beings with a heart, the Tseltalero dress has a hart too, suggesting the dress is alive. María’s research on this dress is developed in conversation with the Tojolabal community of San Gregorio la Esperanza. It explores the complex value of this dress within the Tojolabal and Tseltal worldview, sharing some ideas about beauty, garments and the body from a non-Eurocentric perspective.Care instructions:This object is made from a washable paper;Neobond 60.200 SUPER.Please wear* and wash with care:–Preferably wash by hand.–Machine wash: max 30 degrees with delicate program.–Do not tumble dry.*Disclaimer; this object is made of Neobond 60.200 SUPER. This is a synthetic paper that doesn’t contain the OEKO TEX label.Limited edition of 195 copies.Dimensions magazine: 20,5 x 29,5 cmDimensions apron: 58,5 x 81,5 cmPages: 16Art Direction: Anouk BeckersDesign and Research:Anouk Beckers & Alessandra VariscoGraphic Design: Rietlanden Women’s OfficeText: María Naidich, Femke de VriesEditors: Valentina Sarmiento Cruz, Hanka van der VoetSpanish Copy Editor: Davo ValdésEnglish Copy Editor: Kat AddisTranslators: Carmelino Méndez Jiménez, Valentina Sarmiento Cruz, Nassima Nejjari, Dakota Guo, Guadalupe Castillo VizueteFull colour, printed at robstolk"

Or we heard about the guy who mined thousands of coins but then lost the key to his fortune. How we coulda, shoulda. My Bitcoin story is...""(From the introduction by Michael Schmelling)Though the idea of a decentralised, universal digital currency had long been the dream of cryptographers since at least the early 1980s, it wasn’t until 2009 that the now famous (yet presumably pseudonymous) developer Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first 50 Bitcoins. Not long after, Nakamoto withdrew from the community he'd created, went silent, and then disappeared entirely.Cryptocurrencies more or less went mainstream in 2022 with celebrity endorsed Super Bowl ads, but just ten years prior, Bitcoin only thrived on the fringes of the internet. If you’d heard about Bitcoin in that era at all, it was likely in relation to the dark web blackmarket site Silk Road, or WikiLeaks. It was in these early days of Bitcoin — concurrently the waning days of print media — that Michael Schmelling was hired to photograph a man named Bruce Wagner. Wagner was an early proselytiser for Bitcoin and hosted a show on YouTube called The Bitcoin Show.On a sunny Autumn day in New York City, with the price of Bitcoin hovering around $3.25 per coin, Schmelling photographed Wagner at an ad-hoc television studio in Midtown, and then outside the first restaurant in the city to accept Bitcoin as payment. Wagner seemed a true salesman, grinning and talkative, extolling the virtues of Bitcoin. After the shoot was over, he told Schmelling to take whatever fee he was making that day and spend it all on Bitcoin.There didn't appear to be anything remarkable about this editorial assignment at the time, but over the years, as the price of Bitcoin rose, the photographs began to gather weight, as photographs often do.142 x 211 mm224pp paperback with dustjacket146 colour photographsLithoprinted on coated paperEdition of 750Price at 11:41 am, Jan 12 2023: $9.71Nov 13Nov 20Nov 27Dec 04Dec 11Dec 18Dec 252023Jan 08102030"

The recordings are then used in two ways.On the one hand they are used to create a sound composition which explores the resonances of the chosen places by repeatedly recycling or “feeding back” the sounds of the gunshots through the spaces. The resulting piece moves from a dramatic realism to an abstract composition reminiscent of the electronic music of the 1950’s. On the other hand they are used as a kind of sonar; the stereo (and therefore 2 dimensional) sound data is analysed for spatial and spectral characteristics which are plotted against each other, resulting in a visual map of the acoustic space. These maps, drawn by a computer programme, resemble the visual spaces themselves only in terms of scale: a larger, open space results in a wider pattern of lines.Because of the complexity of the acoustic reality of an urban space, the link between the physical plan of the space and the corresponding 'sonar map' is very tenuous. But still they tell us something about the space. The experience of listening to an urban soundscape is difficult to describe, in words or in notation. These maps suggest a way to describe the open-ness or closed-ness of spaces, the density of reflections and reverberation, the presence of strong resonances or mechanical drones.Shotgun Architecture by Justin Bennett10"" vinyl record with agraphic posterSide one: ABN-AMRO, Gershwin, ING, ITO, Mahler, WTCSide two: Shotgun ArchitectureISBN: 978-90-78454-21-2Graphic design: Remco van BladelPrinted by Lecturis, Eindhoven on Reprobank 60 gr/m2."

Elisa van Joolen initiated this new edition of PORTAL (2017-ongoing) for the exhibition ‘Refresh Amsterdam’ at Amsterdam Museum in collaboration with de Appel. This edition was made with group 2 students (12–14 years old) as part of ‘Kunstklassen’, an arts education programme organised by de Appel and Comenius Lyceum.The publication shows a trail of connections between personal, economic, social, cultural and political values of the garments worn by Comenius Lyceum students.PORTAL is a research project that explores the economic, social and emotional value of clothing and offers a ‘way in’ to understanding garments from a multitude of overlapping and intersecting perspectives.For every edition, participants are asked to take off a garment, lay it down on a large Tyvek sheet, outline their garment with tape and answer a series of questions regarding its production (Where was it made?), materials (What is it made of?), ownership (Is it yours?) and value (How much did it cost? What is the emotional value?). Subsequently connections are made between the garments by literally drawing lines between the items of the various visitors, creating a network that reveals connections between and intersections of personal, economic, social, cultural and political realms surfacing a complex and layered system of the reality of clothing. This culminates in a map, or landscape of personal stories that connect to form a fashion network which inverts our gaze, shining a spotlight on the intricacies of our own outfits and extraordinary aspects of the everyday as opposed to the myth of the exclusive fashion image. PORTAL thus provides an entryway to a vision that begins to prioritise values that are ephemeral and yet integral in “influencing hearts and minds and shaping the way we live together”. It captures and visualises information that circumvents established hierarchies and disrupts the homogeneity of the commercially driven fashion system with the refreshing diversity of fashion that is worn; embodied and imperfect.The collected information of each PORTAL edition is visualized and brought together in a reader using the sixteen PORTAL questions as their starting point.Type: softcoverDimensions: 210 mm x 297 mm portraitPages: 40Art Direction: Elisa van JoolenResearch assistant: Anouk BeckersText: Ali, Dina, Fatima, Hafsa, Halime, Israe, Khaled, Mohammed, Rabia, Safae, Sara, Youssef, and ZülalGraphic design: Bart de BaetsRelease date: Spring 2021Binding: staplesEdition: 250Color: full color – Offset printedPrinter: FlyeralarmLanguage: EnglishText editing: Melanie BomansMade possible by: Amsterdam Museum, de AppelProduction: WarehouseProduction assistant: Anouk Beckers"
Passage,//3ssstudios.com/cdn/shop/products/IMG_3267_1080x1530.jpg?v=1667528450,https://3ssstudios.com/collections/publications/products/passage,Philippe Fragnière,"PASSAGE results from a ten-year long engagement with the nature and landscapes around the small village of Veysonnaz, located in the Wallis region of the Swiss Alps. Photographer Philippe Fragnièrewalked the same paths as his ancestors in an attempt to sense what they had felt. From legends and hearsay, he borrowed motifs and a narrative device: ‘objects’ are singled-out, at times moved into a studio, and made into provisional totems. Vernacular architectures and amphibians appear alongside land, flora, and fungi, formally elevated into symbols. Alongside one another, they capture the photographer’s phenomenological experience of a terrain to which he returned as he moved through grief. Comfort was found in the cycle of seasons, and in time so infinitely slow it appears still. Like glass, neither solid nor liquid, the images as a sequence exist in suspension, caught between fact and fiction. Scale has no bearing – all is magnified and made equivalent. Does something exist, the photographer asks, factually or fictively, if no one records it?“If you listen closely, the glass in the windows melts away and flows into streams, faraway. We inhabit fountains.” A commissioned short-story by Swiss author Valmir Rexhepi accompanies the images. Dialogues form short poems when read separately from a text that flows from top to bottom over both pages. The story’s characters are described topographically; selves are produced through the encounter with an environment that is overly familiar yet elusive. Together, the images and text point to the desire to make land speak.Short novel by Valmir RexhepiEnglish20.8 × 34 cm136 pages96 color and black & white platesSoftcoverISBN 978-3-03747-112-8"

As counterpart to these photograms, the other end of the exhibition consists of black and white 35mm films. Some monochromatic animation films are projected together with short real-life sequences. The publication traces the conflicting forces of photography and film within his work, up to the point that, at the end, we rediscover the principles that constituted the abstract photograms at the beginning, transposed into the linearity of the medium of film.192 p, ills bw, 20 x 30 cm, pb, english & frenchWith texts by Marie Muracciole and Jean-François Chevrier.Design: Joris Kritis.ISBN 978-94-6446-000-1"

This experiment inspired Gadonneix to question the artificial reproduction of phenomena that are simultaneously scientific and enigmatic in nature. She imagines the laboratory as a world theatre in this context, uniting within itself universal history and the experience of thought. It becomes a place of exploration and representation for unpredictable phenomena such as tornadoes, black holes and earthquakes; where their elements of chance seem manipulateable, achievable and reproducible by pushing their physics to their limits through the scientists’ conceptualization.23 x 30 cmSoft CoverDust Jacket240 pages102 color photographs"

WithFigures, he trains his camera on figures both his own and numerical, arranged by chance mathematical operations.Lucas Blalock (born 1978 in Asheville, North Carolina, lives and works in Brooklyn, New York) makes darkly comic photographs that probe discomfiting corners of the psyche while making a bawdy mess of staid photographic norms. His pictures are purposely awkward, ham-fisted, and jury-rigged. They are constructed with software that normally fades into the background, but which he thrusts center stage. Anyone with a rudimentary working knowledge of Photoshop can understand the methods Blalock employs—a jittery fuzz of clone stamping here, an irregular bit of masking there. Indeed, these are not the tricks he has up his sleeve. And this feeling that we can see the gears of the image turning is part of Blalock's program.Published in November 2021No text19,5 x 28,3 cm (softcover)128 pages (ill.)ISBN :978-1-7345275-4-4"

Intermediary platforms between practitioners and the public can come in the form of specific tools (Instagram, for example) or even events that are organized for that purpose (festivals and exhibitions). The conference is one of these platforms. A true ephemeral editorial object, it is highly suited to the explanation and extension of the practices and methodologies of designers. It is, for certain designers, the opportunity to take stock of an approach, an inventory of finished forms, and for others, on the contrary, a pretext for the production of new, sometimes more performative, even experimental forms.AboutRevue FaireAdopting an analytical and critical posture with regard to the forms and activities of Graphic Design, Sacha Léopold and François Havegeer established in 2017 a printed publication that deals with these practices.

The object which resulted gradually took on the appearance of a photo album, a typeface specimen, and a color chart. On the cover, the phrase “Dear Lulu, Please try and print these line, color, pattern, format, texture and typography tests for us” is clearly addressed to the online print platform for which this book was proposed as a test.Ten years later, the offer has become more diverse and the success of such online platforms is undeniable—indeed the phenomenon has spread well beyond the field of publishing. While some bemoan unfair competition for printers, others, professionals and amateurs, see in it a freedom to print and distribute relatively well finished objects at low cost.The possibilities of these systems of production, are multiple but nonetheless limited, and this obviously raises the question of a possible standardization of forms and formats. However, when it comes to Print On Demand, it seems that the issue is not so much the materiality of an object (the choice of format, paper or a particular manufacture) but rather the actual existence of this object itself, outside of usual channels of production and distribution.AboutRevue FaireAdopting an analytical and critical posture with regard to the forms and activities of Graphic Design, Sacha Léopold and François Havegeer established in 2017 a printed publication that deals with these practices.

A book design award with such history, particularly in a book-making culture as rich as Switzerland’s, offers insightful perspectives on Graphic Design for publishing, the culture that commissions and values it, and the critical discourse that surrounds it.Each year the awarded books are documented in a substantial catalogue, made by one of the graphic designers awarded in previous years. The inherently self-reflexive tendencies of such catalogues—books about books, Graphic Design in the context of Graphic Design—present stimulating yet rather fraught conditions for graphic designers to work in. Looking back over the catalogues produced during the last two decades, a conversation-through-practice is clearly legible. After a conceptually sophisticated catalogue or series (often designers have been commissioned for series of two or three catalogues) follows a simple visual document. After a modest, finely-crafted production comes something more lavish or experimental.The 2004–2006 catalogues were conceived by Laurent Benner, a Swiss designer working in London, and designed with English designer Jonathan Hares. Laurent’s proposition for the 2004 catalogue was audacious. He contacted the printers of each of the 20 awarded books from that year and asked them to reprint a section of their book. These reprinted sections were then transported to a single Swiss bookbinder and bound, with some additional pages of front- and back-matter, to comprise the catalogue.AboutRevue FaireAdopting an analytical and critical posture with regard to the forms and activities of Graphic Design, Sacha Léopold and François Havegeer established in 2017 a printed publication that deals with these practices.

The main question was and has always been, even before the invention of printing, the regulation of the circulation of writing, and the designation of those responsible for their inscription and distribution.Robin Kinross identified the emergence of the modern figure of the typographer in the 17thcentury, withThe doctrine of handy-works: applied to the art of printingby Joseph Moxon (Robin Kinross, Moderntypography: An Essay in Critical History, Hyphen Press, London, 2004 (1992) pp. 15-16). But long before this, graphic artists, copyists, and typographers such as Geoffroy Tory and Henri Estienne the elder were both booksellers and publishers who gave much thought to their practice and the contents that they released into the public space.It would seem that the time has come to reassess this ancient tradition, with more and more graphic artists and designers choosing to establish their own publishing houses in order to defend their editorial approach in both senses of the word—that of “editing” and the choice and organization of graphic material, but also in the sense of “publishing”, applying a certain ethic to the distribution and advertising of the contents.AboutRevue FaireAdopting an analytical and critical posture with regard to the forms and activities of Graphic Design, Sacha Léopold and François Havegeer established in 2017 a printed publication that deals with these practices.

However, despite being developed over 15 years by one of the major Graphic Design studios with a reputation that has been established on an international scale, the work of M/M (Paris) for the CDDB (Centre Dramatique de Bretagne) Théâtre of Lorient has largely not been examined in relation to this tradition.The posters made by M/M (Paris) for the CDDB are remarkable on more than one level: the timescale of the work, for one, along with the consistency of its principles (black and white text related to a photograph reproduced in four colors), and the power of the relationship that exists between Graphic Designers and their client, CDDB director Eric Vigner. If that is not enough, one can also highlight the critical dimension of these posters, as much in relation to theatre as Graphic Design, while also emphasizing their singularity and their innovative character, in direct rupture with the habits of the French cultural poster.We could continue to argue over the necessity of dealing one-by-one with the points raised by this work, but we prefer to look at it as the unpublished journal of M/M (Paris) that speaks about them, their work, and the world. “But it is not like surfers who advocate ‘surf’ culture. We are not advocating a Graphic Design culture” (M/M (Paris)). Commissioned by, and an integral part of, the CDDB project, these posters are intimately linked to the career of M/M (Paris), and they contain numerous fragments from it: voyages and busy places, steps along their route, traces of other projects, such as catalogues by Yohji Yamamoto, or a collaboration with Björk who, photographed during the making of the cover for herVespertinealbum, became, with photographer Inez van Lamsweerde, the protagonist of Duras’Savannah Bay. It will therefore be necessary to follow the trail laid by these clues, and to propose a reading of it.AboutRevue FaireAdopting an analytical and critical posture with regard to the forms and activities of Graphic Design, Sacha Léopold and François Havegeer established in 2017 a printed publication that deals with these practices.

These posters could then function on two levels: as the content for an exhibition (the newly created collection would be presented, accompanied by the sketches that led to the creation of the different posters) and in the streets of the city where the posters would be hung in order to promote and provide information about the event.With this invitation, the designer/curator wished to respond to the idea that the exhibition space isolates Graphic Design creations from the real world, from context (commercial, cultural, historic) and from the function that is necessary for reading and understanding them. He thus chose to make the conditions of the exhibition space (in this case the Moravian Gallery) the context for the creations, and to exhibit the work of Graphic Designers rather than objects.This strategy, which doesn’t hide its self-referential nature, was accompanied by an essay, written by Bil’ak himself; a text that continues to be regularly cited when the question of approaching the exhibition of Graphic Design as a subject arises. Our study will engage the analysis of this latter in order to question the characteristically theoretical approach of this project. It will attempt to place the reflexive, discursive approach and the editorial part of this curatorial proposition within the recent history of Graphic Design. It will also try to show how the positions taken will lead to a form of redefinition of Graphic Design.AboutRevue FaireAdopting an analytical and critical posture with regard to the forms and activities of Graphic Design, Sacha Léopold and François Havegeer established in 2017 a printed publication that deals with these practices.

In it appeared the first “advertisements.” The initial meaning given to this term was that of rendering something public, and Renaudot, a man of multiple pursuits, endeavored then to apply his adage: “For just as ignorance dares desire, since it is impossible to desire what one does not know, even the knowledge of things makes us envious.”These syllogistic and paradoxical relationships between the stimulation of desire, masked ignorance, and longing lead to the exploration of the tensions that exist between audience, advertising, and eroticism.

It does however lead to thinking around the idea of parergon, of adornment, and also of armor ashabillemens, from the ancient French word for clothing, etymologically the engine, the weapon, the war machine.

"n°07 — A book: Parallel Encyclopedia, Batia Suter.",//3ssstudios.com/cdn/shop/products/7_0_1080x1530.png?v=1636912416,https://3ssstudios.com/collections/publications/products/n-07-a-book-parallel-encyclopedia-batia-suter,Revue Faire,"Author: Jérôme DupeyratSince the end of the 1990s, Batia Suter has been collecting books—second hand for the most part—that she acquires for their iconography, in such a way as to build up an image database that sits on the shelves of her personal library. All of this has become the basic material for an artwork that consists of presenting the images according to a logic of visual editing, providing them with new modalities of appearance and thus new possibilities of interpretation.Parallel Encyclopedia is, at the time of writing, the artist’s most significant work. Ongoing since 2004, it has taken the form of a number of installations and two imposing publications from Roma Publications published in 2007 and 2016. Each version of the project is characterized by the association of hundreds of heteroclite images (historical, artistic, scientific, and technical), grouped according to typological and formal links. From one system to another, the conditions of presentation of these images taken from books are renewed: the sequencing and seriality of bound pages; constellations or, on the contrary, linear sequences of images reproduced and exhibited on wall panels; constellations or linear sequences of book pages opened and placed on flat mounts. Though the exhibited images are the same, these various exhibition possibilities determine differential readings.Beyond the fascination that such a project can generate, this text will attempt to seize all of its complexity. To do this, Batia Suter’s work will be re-situated within the context of a history of iconographic practices that run through different fields of activities and knowledge. We will also focus on the trajectory of the images gathered inParallel Encyclopediaand the effects of the process of remediation to which they are subjected. Ultimately, it will be a question of drawing a figure of the artist as an “editor” and of studying both the function of Graphic Design in the artist’s work and the place that we can attribute to the artist in the field of Graphic Design, a field to which Batia Suter doesn’t directly belong, but one that runs through her productions, and to which she was confronted in a concrete fashion in the context of her collaboration with the Graphic Designer Roger Willems in the design of the two volumes of the encyclopedia that, in fact, is today a reference for many artists, as much as it is for a large number of Graphic Designers.AboutRevue FaireAdopting an analytical and critical posture with regard to the forms and activities of Graphic Design, Sacha Léopold and François Havegeer established in 2017 a printed publication that deals with these practices.

Entitled “P/Pa/Para/Paradiso” it presented, as a whole and in its details, their new posters for the Paradiso center for music and culture in Amsterdam. Apart from the obvious formal relationship with theBlow Upposter that they created in 2007 for the London Design Museum, this slideshow gives very few keys to read what seemed to be a new aspect of the center’s communication, something that Experimental Jetset had been working on since 1996.Currently having over 1,500 likes and tens of comments, this post is where my article begins. An opportunity to investigate and review this collaboration, that over 20 years has taken various forms (flyers, programs, posters), along with the singular and radical practice of Experimental Jetset. And also the opportunity to provide a more theoretical view of the way that Graphic Design is shown and seen on different platforms, that have now become an integral part of the teaching and the evolution of the discipline.AboutRevue FaireAdopting an analytical and critical posture with regard to the forms and activities of Graphic Design, Sacha Léopold and François Havegeer established in 2017 a printed publication that deals with these practices.

n°04 — A communication: invitation cards by the artist Stanley Brouwn.,//3ssstudios.com/cdn/shop/products/4_0_1080x1530.png?v=1636732954,https://3ssstudios.com/collections/publications/products/n-04-a-communication-invitation-cards-by-the-artist-stanley-brouwn,Revue Faire,"Author: Céline ChazalvielIf we could attribute to Stanley Brouwn a desire to dissociate his artistic production from who he is and to reveal otherness through the mastery of his image and that of his work, we could also divine an intention to focus the public’s attention on his exhibitions. Behind the standards put in place for the communication related to his exhibitions—the use of lowercase and Helvetica exclusively, the refusal to reproduce images of his work, to produce (or allow production of) written commentary on the subject of the same work, to appear in the context of a vernissage or even to answer an interview—the artist builds his identity by way of ellipses. Since his participation indocumenta 5(1972), the stories linked to this attitude have come to draw the outlines of an artistic posture that goes beyond any one particular case. The invitation cards for his solo exhibitions provide a symptomatic example: set almost exclusively in Helvetica, the absence of uppercase, flying in the face of the graphic identity of the gallery or the host institution, they seem impossible to date, give or take twenty years.This mastery reveals that graphic and typographic choices represent one of the spaces of neutrality built by Brouwn, like other artists and theoreticians of his generation, and generations that came after. According to one of the positions of Sol Lewitt, “conceptual artists are more mystical than rationalist,” and the case of Brouwn gives weight to this idea. Whether it be by way of a mediation adopted by the artist himself and the relationship with the institution that it entails, that of the myth of the autonomy of the artwork, of the relationship with documentation, with commentary and the analysis of an artwork or even the conditions of reception, Brouwn escapes the category of the conceptual artist and incites us to measure the contemporary echoes of his radicality.AboutRevue FaireAdopting an analytical and critical posture with regard to the forms and activities of Graphic Design, Sacha Léopold and François Havegeer established in 2017 a printed publication that deals with these practices.

As Guidi follows the canal from out in the suburbs toward the city centre, his attention and visual language move from the vernacular to the metropolitan, from wider horizontal views to vertical ‘cuts’ in the urban fabric, from entire buildings and scenes to glimpsed façades and doorways. Along the way, we also encounter inhabitants: a group of young men gathered in a Pasolini-like scene on a bridge in the city’s outskirts; occasional passers-by working, shopping, or stopping to smoke on the city streets; disconnected couples and disparate individuals whose loose citizenship coheres the urban sprawl.While previous books, such asPer Strada(2018) andTra l'altro(2020), demonstrated Guidi’s fascination with the rural and small-town landscapes of his native region,Cinque viaggiturns to metropolitan Italy, documenting the dramatic socio-economic changes that have transformed it over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Remnants of rural civilisation and traces of urban expansion are embedded among the first signs of de-industrialisation. These 110 large-format works, many of which have never been seen before, reveal the layers of social and architectural history among which everyday life unfolds.Cinque viaggioffers an arrestingly subtle picture of Italy's recent past and rumination on its future.With essays by Corrado Benigni, Antonello Frongia, and Roberta Valtorta.Accompanies an exhibition presented by Fondazione MIAat the Monastero di Astino,Bergamo, Italy from 11 June – 30 September 2021.Printed hardcoverBilingual text (English, Italian)30 x 30cm, 152 pagesISBN 978-1-913620-32-5June 2021"

Political demonstrations, humanitarian emergencies, and quiet moments of everyday life. What holds all these images together is a sense of theatre. A sense that we are all actors, all playing the parts that history and circumstance demand of us. Majoli’s photographs result from his own performance. Entering a situation, he and his assistants slowly go about setting up a camera and lights. This activity is a kind of spectacle in itself, observed by those who will eventually be photographed. Majoli begins to shoot, offering no direction to the people before his camera. This might happen over twenty minutes. It might be an hour or so.Perhaps the people adjust their actions in anticipation of the image to come. Perhaps they refine their gestures in self-consciousness. Perhaps they do not. The representation of drama and the drama of representation become one. The camera flash is instantaneous and much stronger than daylight. But all this light plunges the world into night, or moonlight. The world appears as an illuminated stage. Everything seems to be happening at the end of the day. Just when the world should be sleeping, it offers a heightened performance of itself.We never really see people or places: we see the light they reflect. And the quality of that light affects how we understand them.- David CampanyLarge-format paperback with jacket126 pages38 x 22.5 cmEssays by David Campany andCorinne RondeauPublication date: February 2019Co-published with Le Bal, ParisISBN: 978-1-912339-29-7 (English edition)"

Awarded the Paris Photo-Aperture Prize for the most significant photobook published in the past 15 years, the original 12 volume set sold out in 10 weeks, and has been out of print since.Shimmercomprises 12 individual books, each volume a photographic short story of everyday life in today’s America. Modest sequences of images, such as a man smoking a cigarette while waiting for a bus in Las Vegas, or a woman collecting her mail from a mailbox in leafy New England, reflect the poetic ebb and flow of life. Now and then, the quiet narrative slides unexpectedly into the sublime: as a man mows a large green expanse, the sunlight breaks through clouds to illuminate a curtain of glowing raindrops. These filmic haikus avoid the forceful summation we usually find in photography, shunning a tidy packaging of the world into perfect images, to speak instead about the unexamined depths of quotidian life.Whilst the 12 books are all an identical size, they vary in length from just a single photograph to 60 pages of images made at one street intersection. The radical form of this multi volume publication embraces the unique nature of Graham’s work, giving the flow of life precedence over conclusiveness, where nothing much happens, but nothing is foreclosed either, where everything shimmers with possibility.Embossed paper-bound hardback120 pages23.5 x 23.5 cmPublication date: April 2018ISBN: 978-1-912339-00-6"

Constructing images in domestic environments from items found in arm’s reach, the results are absurdist constructions in which commonplace objects are jocosely rendered in polychromatic puzzles.Salveson describes his photographic process as 'unfolding like a private performance in an empty house, or after everyone falls asleep... my engagement emerges from a perspective that precedes familiarity, disregarding the functions and cultural associations that objects are assigned. I try to process my surroundings with an alien mind.Winner of the 2013First Book Award76 pages38 colour plates19 cm x 26 cmBoard bookPublication date: November 2013ISBN 9781907946431"
